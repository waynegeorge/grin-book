From the doc:
"Bitcoin’s 10 minute block time has its intitial 50 btc reward cut in half every 4 years until there are 21 million bitcoin in circulation. Grin’s emission rate is linear, meaning it never drops. The block reward is currently set at 50 grin with a block goal of 60 seconds. "

Has this been discussed somewhere ? Is it acted?
Not that I’m necessarily against this, but I just wonder the reasons behind this decision.

Yes, consideration was given  But considerations can differ with time and circumstance. More specifically:

* Over 2 years have passed since that change, we have likely another 2 years before having larger blocks could become an issue. Several studies have shown that worldwide bandwidth capacity has increased significantly in the past few years.
* We’re starting with compact blocks and compact rage proofs right away, so our blocks should be significantly smaller (and faster to propagate) than full Monero blocks with ring-CT.

Investors usually buy the coin they expect the most profit from and can sell in hours.

It’s miners that make the value of the coin and bear the risks of a loss.

See, it works both ways

I still can’t wrap my head around people being so worried, when a classic bitcoin-like issuance would still be flat for the first 4 years. The first 4 years of life in a coin is eternity. Who knows what it’ll be like in 4 years!?

With respect to this whole thread and future ones, if you want to provide constructive criticisms on the emission curve, at least give it some decent thoughts. Repeating what you read on Reddit doesn’t count.

To be more specific:

* At a minimum consider the loss rate when building supply curve. Ever wondered at which point 50% of those 21M bitcoins will have disappeared, for example?
* Compare with other slow emission coins. After 8 years, grin only has 33% more supply than bitcoin or, to pick something more recent, zcash. Argue why this matters (or not).
* Compare with fast emissions coins. Monero had over half emitted in 17 months. How does that affect long term adoption? How about use?
* Rich lists and coin decentralization. What affects them.
* Analyze average crypto user and investor behavior. How does multi-year emission curves, fast or slow, influence them? What are the real adoption drivers, both long and short term?
* Do not use econ101 in your arguments. That can be used to argue anything and its opposite equally well. And before telling us we don’t understand economics, convince Nouriel. Then maybe I’ll listen.
* Consider different strategies and how they can play the strengths or weaknesses of various blockchains. What is the effect on Ethereum when daily supply is hard forked for example?
* Facts and real research. Unsubstantiated opinions are a nanogrin a dozen.

The grin team is earnest, if you can provide well substantiated real research that shows a different supply curve would be be better for grin, we will most definitely listen. But don’t think you can flyby post your knee-jerk reaction 5 min after having heard of grin, which we’ve spent the last 2 years building, and expect us to listen to you.

Some Yannis Varoufakis quotes:

"First, deflation is unavoidable in the bitcoin community because the maximum supply of bitcoins is fixed to 21 million bitcoins and approximately half of them have already been ‘minted’ at a time when very, very few goods and services transactions are denominated in bitcoins. To put simply, if bitcoin succeeds in penetrating the marketplace, an increasing quantity of new goods and services will be traded in bitcoin. By definition, the rate of increase in that quantity will outpace the rate of increase in the supply of bitcoins (a rate which, as explain, is severely constricted by the Nakamoto algorithm). In short, a restricted supply of bitcoins will be chasing after an increasing number of goods and services. Thus, the available quantity of bitcoins per each unit of goods and services will be falling causing deflation. And why is this a problem? For two reasons: First, because an expected fall in bitcoin prices motivates people with bitcoins to delay, as much as they can, their bitcoin expenditure (why buy something today if it will be cheaper tomorrow?). Secondly, because to the extent that bitcoins are used to buy factors of production that are used to produce goods and services, and assuming that there is some time lag between the purchase of these factors and the delivery of the final product to the bitcoin market, a steady fall in average prices will translate into a constantly shrinking price-cost margin for firms dealing in bitcoins.

Secondly, two major faultlines are developing, quite inevitably, within the bitcoin economy. The first faultline has already been mentioned. It is the one that divides the ‘bitcoin aristocracy’ from the ‘bitcoin poor’, i.e. from the latecomers who must buy into bitcoin at increasing dollar and euro prices. The second faultline separates the speculators from the users; i.e. those who see bitcoin as a means of exchange from those who see in it as a stock of value. The combination of these two faultlines, whose width and depth is increasing, is to inject a massive instability potential into the bitcoin universe. While it is true for all currencies that there is always some speculative demand for them, as opposed to transactions demand, in the case of bitcoin speculative demand outstrips transactions demand by a mile. And as long as this is so, volatility will remain huge and will deter those who might have wanted to enter the bitcoin economy as users (as opposed to speculators). Thus, just like bad money drives out good money (Gresham’s famous ‘law’), speculative demand for bitcoins drives our transactions demand for it."

(from <https://www.yanisvaroufakis.eu/2013/04/22/bitcoin-and-the-dangerous-fantasy-of-apolitical-money/>)

“Bitcoin is too deflationary by nature to act as a widespread currency alternative to the dollar or the euro”

(from <https://www.yanisvaroufakis.eu/2014/02/15/bitcoin-a-flawed-currency-blueprint-with-a-potentially-useful-application-for-the-eurozone/>)

Note that Yannis considers any predetermined emission to be economically flawed; he would simply find Grin’s emission to be slightly less flawed than Bitcoin’s.

## ASICs and Governance

### Post by @igno.peverell ⭐ (2018-05-09)
*Post #1*

Thought I’d spin off a more durable discussion here from Gitter, as it’s a topic that many should be interested in. It’s also a good first governance-related topic. Warning: it’s a long read.

The news that influence this discussion is the release by Bitmain of Ethash (Ethereum), Cryptonight (Monero) and Equihash (Zcash) miners. The fact they’re announced around the same time may not be coincidental. It could be a marketing strategy, or it could be that bitmain has become a lot better at producing ASICs for less classic algos.

Moving on to Cucko Cycle, it’s unclear how much more (or less) ASIC-resistant the algo is. If the ultimate bottleneck is really memory latency and/or bandwidth, ASICs would only provide minimal advantages (because you hit DRAM speed limits, which is the same everywhere). But we haven’t reached a level of optimization of the mining software that would corroborate this claim yet. So the best we could hope for regarding Cuckoo Cycle ASIC resistance is that ASICs would provide less of a speedup compared to other algos, and would possible be more expensive. Especially if we move up cycle size from Cuckoo30 to 31 and 32 in the future.

Also, while the strengths of PoW and how ASICs are the best outcome in an ideal market are good to discuss, that’s already [been done](https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/asic-faq.pdf). I’m much more interested in discussing the impact in the current market and its realities.

I would propose assessing a given proof-of-work mining ecosystem using only these 2 criteria:

1. Does it provide enough security to the chain against a 51% attack?
2. Is it decentralized enough to provide a good level of censorship resistance?

ASICs in theory improve on the first criteria, coming close to optimal efficiency and are neutral on the second. So for that reason and the fact that they’re technically better, I’d generally prefer ASICs to mine.

But practically, the current ASIC market is disastrous for decentralization and censorship resistance and shows no sign of evolving in the right direction. Bitmain’s business practices have made them very successful, they’ve repeatedly shown they could outcompete other manufacturers and even kill new entrants, and that over multiple years. They’ve also shown they were not afraid to enter into dubious agreements with their clients. Proof of work security is very sensitive to cartels (that’s a technical statement btw, not a moral one). So I’m not optimistic the market will “work it out”, at least in the short and medium terms.

Cryptocurrency communities have reacted in different ways:

* Monero has pledged to keep ASIC resistance and hard fork when needed (helps that they hard fork every 6 months regardless).
* Zcash seems to be taking a wait-and-see approach for now.
* Ethereum is moving toward proof of stake regardless, and the ASIC efficiency gain seems lesser on Ethash, so they seem to be fine.
* Honey badger don’t care.

So what should we do? I’ll write down a couple additional thoughts before jumping to my own take:

* Maintaining ASIC resistance in the long term is futile. No matter what, ASICs can be built and will have at least some additional efficiency gains, even if minimal. As the overall market size increases, building new ASICs gets more affordable.
* Being overtly ready to hard fork every time, in the long term, is a bad strategy. You’re signing up either for people developing ASICs secretely to avoid the next fork, or getting forced to hard fork in random ways very regularly “just in case”.
* GPU mining isn’t necessarily doomed. Many people have purchased GPUs for other reasons (like Call of Duty), so as long as the efficiency is still reasonable, they can compete with professional miners because their equipment is a sunk cost.
* “Young coins” like us are much more sensitive to these pressures because both the mining ecosystem and the market are still small. So we need to start with as high a bar as possible in terms of censorship resistance. Not to mention that Grin is privacy centric, so censorship resistance is very important to us.

I think we’re trying to protect ourselves for the short to mid term. There’s only so much we can do anyway and we have to hope the market will, eventually, work this out. So here are 2 strategies that I could see myself supporting (until someone comes up with better):

1. Wait and see until we’re fully ready for mainnet and do not promise anything either way. This is the most comfortable for us developers, but the least for our community. So I wouldn’t want to keep that approach past mainnet.
2. Maintain ASIC resistance for the first 2 years. This duration makes sense because we have already planned hard forks and should give enough time for at least _our_ market to mature. We could do this by increasing graph size and possibly tweaking cycle lengths if necessary.

What are your thoughts?

### Post by @tromp ⭐ (2018-05-09)

I do consider GPU mining ultimately doomed. When mining a PoW that’s bottlenecked by memory, a GPU will still use a large fraction of its power in its computing cores (Streaming Multiprocessors on NVIDIA) juggling threads, decoding instructions, and what not. An ASIC hooked up to the same memory chips will avoid nearly all this power and just use power for moving memory around. This gives it a large improvement in efficiency, which should make GPUs unprofitable.

There is one possibility where GPUs could remain somewhat competitive, and that is one I’m actually hoping for: in theory a GPU could include an accelerator for a specific PoW that would re-use the GPUs memory resources but put all remaining, unneeded, GPU circuitry in some sort of sleep mode. But this hinges on several other requirements as well. E.g. if lean mining turns out to be the preferred ASIC approach, then the GPU may need to have access to a generous amount of external SRAM.

Increasing graph size whenever possible is good to reduce the risk of single chip (and memory bottleneck avoiding) ASICs becoming economically feasible. We should be willing to do that even after 2 years. At least such changes could be considered integral to the design and not
particularly controversial.

Changing cycle length should have no effect on ASICs as (barring any algorithmic breakthroughs) they should be focussing on edge trimming, and the cycle finding can be done in a post-processing phase that’s offloaded to a CPU, just as it is in the current GPU solvers.

In general the situation around ASIC resistance reminds me “machines will steal our jobs”, see Luddites [1]. It’s well described in the chapter 7 of `Economics in One Lesson` [2]:

> THE CURSE OF MACHINERY
>  AMONG THE MOST viable of all economic delusions is the belief that machines on net balance create unemployment. Destroyed a thousand times, it has risen a thousand times out of its own ashes as hardy and vigorous as ever.
>  …
>  Arkwright invented his cotton-spinning machinery in 1760. … Yet in 1787—twenty-seven years after the invention appeared—a parliamentary inquiry showed that the number of persons actually engaged in the spinning and weaving of cotton had risen from 7,900 to 320,000, an increase of 4,400 percent.
>  …
>  By 1961 there was no sign that the fallacy had died. Not only union leaders but government officials talked solemnly of “automation” as a major cause of unemployment.

Hazlitt was writing about unemployment, but I think it’s equally applicable to any fears. I’m sure that wide adoption of asics will improve security of networks, decentralisation and censorship resistance. So I’m with Igno when he describes his long-term position.

I’m not sure that “young coins” need to protect themselves for the short to mid term. Exactly because “both the mining ecosystem and the market are still small”. ASIC design and production costs a lot, it is justified only for big markets (this my naive understanding of economy of scale and mining industry, could be completely wrong).

I agree that “the current ASIC market is disastrous” but we don’t help by demonizing it, adoption will drive free market forces and as result we will get reasonable prices and amazon’s same day delivery.

Thought I’d clarify what I meant a bit and reply to a few questions/issues.

[@chri2](/u/chri2) I’d be glad to push for open hardware. Practically this is difficult, but we could place bounties in that direction once we have the means to do that.

[@MerlinsBeard](/u/merlinsbeard) I mean censhorship in the wider possible sense. A country forbidding Grin outright, but also regulatory pressure (like Japan forcing exchanges to drop Monero and Zcash), mining cartels trying to kill forks they don’t approve of, online mobs trying to silence opinions they dislike, nodes that are too expensive to be run from Africa, etc. Censorship resistance is the most important attribute of a blockchain that differentiates it from ebay. A lot of what you’ve learnt to like about cryptocurrencies is a consequence of their censorship resistance.

[@monkyyy](/u/monkyyy) my 2X and 8X referred to the numbers for ethash and equihash, Cuckoo Cycle is closer to those than to SHA256.

Otherwise thanks to everyone in this thread for explaining your position.

Fwiw I agree with both the theoretical rationale and the practical assessment, they make a lot of sense to me.

igno.peverell:

>

What is gained by doing the opposite, i.e. agreeing on an approach ahead of mainnet and committing to it? As far as I can see, while the community might benefit a bit from certainty, those who would stand to benefit the most would be miners. The bigger the operation, the more to benefit, as they get more time to test and prepare ahead of time. Though I’m not a miner, I would expect smaller mom & pop mining operations to be able to adapt and/or understand why dev team would want to remain non-commitant and mysterious about some of the decisions until mainnet launch. From my point of view, it seems best for the community to not promise anything and seek to do what’s possible to give as even as possible playing field for Mainnet Day 1. After that, it will be survival of the fittest no matter what, I suppose.

What is to be gained by announcing this intention ahead of time? Doesn’t this just give any ASIC mfg teams heads up to think about more [hardfork-resistant designs](https://blog.sia.tech/the-state-of-cryptocurrency-mining-538004a37f9b)? To phrase my question differently, what is lost by taking a public stance of “We’ll deal with issues as they arise, our priorities are censorship resistance and minimising 51% attack risk. All options are on the table, including nuclear.”

From my understanding, it’s the opposite. Professional mining operations need to be very reactive and can make a lot of money doing so. So all their processes are a lot more optimized, from supply chain to faster chip designs or better software management.

Interesting, can you elaborate on what that would look like? And thanks for chiming in!

Taek:

I’m likely missing a lot of what you have in mind, but at face value this seems difficult as most algorithms can’t be patented, at least under U.S. and E.U. patent law. Their implementation can be copyrighted and particular methods of implementation, like a given optimization, could potentially be patented. So while there is prior art, like OIN, it’s usually aimed at protecting specific software (Linux).

I’ve been agonising over a draft e-mail on that topic for almost a year now (period during which I’ve accidentally lost one draft). I’m going to have to ship it soon.

In the meantime, let me ask this: **what are the different types of governance model you’ve identified and which would you prefer for Grin**?

---

### Post by @lehnberg ⭐ (2018-07-04)
*Post #7*

It might be helpful to attempt to define “governance” and what is meant by it. In the blockchain space, I personally like how Vlad Zamfir puts it:

https://twitter.com/vladzamfir/status/974026020234948608:

> [Governance is] the process of establishing, maintaining and revoking the legitimacy of decisions and decision making processes, norms, and principles.

This aligns with my own understanding: Governance is about **how decisions are made** that are seen as **legitimate**. Legitimate, in the eyes of the _participants_ (those involved in making decisions) and the _stakeholders_ (those affected by those decisions). One can be a stakeholder and a participant at the same time, for example the congressman who is also a citizen, or the CEO who is also an employee.

I’ve tried to distill some of my thoughts in general about Governance, what it means in the context of Grin, and some questions to the community, as below.

**A. General**

1. Governance has been a challenge for as long as humans have organised in groups. It’s not a new problem, and it’s certainly not unique to blockchains. There is yet to be a perfect solution, every model comes with its own benefits and limitations. It is not an easy problem and there is no one single obvious solution.
2. If there is no conviction that decisions, actions, solutions will do good, it might be better to tread carefully and instead work to avoid doing harm. Keep it simple, stupid. Less is more. Etc.
3. Governance is not only a design challenge, it’s a social challenge. One can devise the most clever system ever designed, but it won’t matter if the participants and stakeholders do not see it as legitimate.
4. It is in my mind premature to solutionize and talk about “on-chain” or “off-chain” models (the “how”) before having a clear definition about what is to be governed, who the participants and stakeholders are, what the principles are, and what purpose is meant to be achieved with the governance in the first place (the “what”).

**B. Grin**

1. There is a governance model in place already for Grin, even if it may not be explicit or documented in great detail. As a mere observer, from my perspective it looks like a type of meritocracy, where a technocratic council makes decisions, and a leader (Igno) has the right to exercise final say, but hardly ever has the need to do so. Everyone is free to join and participate in this process, but their voice will carry different weight depending on the respect and trust they command among the council’s current participants. You gain trust and respect by making meaningful contributions to the project, with a heavy emphasis on code contribution.
2. There is legitimacy in this existing process, in that there is tacit consent in the community about it. I have not noticed anyone questioning the process with which decisions are being made so far, or challenging decisions as illegitimate. In that regards the current model, in my mind, is working for the time being.
3. That is not to say that there are no contentious topics. For example, the discussion of emission rates have already resulted in public [“promises” of hard forks](https://www.reddit.com/r/grincoin/comments/8oercn/jesus_christ_you_have_high_inflation/e03avnf/), and may also have played a role in the formation of a [new MW project](http://beam-mw.com). There will always be dissent, and this is just one example of a topic. Part of the objective of governance is to ensure that decisions, even those that individuals may disagree with, are still considered legitimate by the community as a whole. This will not always succeed.
4. In general, the larger the community of participants and stakeholders becomes, the more difficult governance and co-ordination becomes. It therefore makes sense to work on formalising a process as early on as possible and iterate, allowing it to evolve together with the community. It’s easier to establish a baseline model in a small community in times of calm, than trying to force a complicated model onto a large community in times of need.
5. At this stage in the project, it’s smooth sailing on fairly calm waters. There is no mainnet, there is no value easily attributed to the project or the network, and people do not seem that heavily invested in or incentivised by particular decision outcomes. This current state is temporary. As the project matures there will be a tonne of issues to resolve and difficult decisions to take that will come to impact many. When this time comes, it will be better to have a governance model in place that has a strong sense of legitimacy in the community and can tackle decisions (no matter the outcome) in a way that is well anchored among stakeholders and participants. Rather than dealing with these issues in an ad-hoc way that may result in the community questioning the validity of the decisions taken.
6. As such, there is in my opinion no better time than right now to start working on formalising a governance model for Grin. Given the relatively early stage of the project, it may offer us learning opportunities before matters become complicated and mistakes costly.
7. On the other hand, there’s also not much use in bike-shedding, or attempts to impose structure and order where none is needed. It could be that this just results in politics and acts as a distraction from meaningful work. But it may also be that it opens up for wider contributions and faster progress. Hard to say at this point, a lot of it depends on those who choose to engage.

**C. Questions to the community**

1. How well do you think the existing model works, today, tomorrow and the day after?
2. What do you think about any attempts to formalise a governance model structure?
3. Are there specific subjects/questions you think are particularly important to be handled through a governance plan for Grin? If so, what are those?
4. Is there a document today, outlining the principles and objectives that represent the mission of the Grin project and its community? If not, is there value in trying to create one?

**D. Resources**

Thanks a lot for thinking about this [@lehnberg](/u/lehnberg), I’ve been trying to flesh out a proposal for a while but it’s a complex topic and I find it quite hard to mix it with development. I might have been trying to boil the ocean all in one go as well.

I generally agree with your general thoughts and your points on Grin. I also think that starting with something now is better than waiting. My take on your questions:

1. How well do you think the existing model works, today, tomorrow and the day after? Today is fine but I agree we have it easy. It’s likely to change fairly rapidly as we approach mainnet.
2. What do you think about any attempts to formalise a governance model structure? It’s a necessity, at least for us. We have to also keep in mind that most of governance is emergent and defined by the people involved. So we have to be careful to not come with a structure that would get too much in the way either. This community is young.
3. Are there specific subjects/questions you think are particularly important to be handled through a governance plan for Grin? If so, what are those? There are a ton: hard forks, how to compensate developers, how to raise funds generally and direct them, what will we do in case of a major flaw allowing arbitrary coin issuance, ASIC resistance, etc.
4. Is there a document today, outlining the principles and objectives that represent the mission of the Grin project and its community? If not, is there value in trying to create one? No and yes.

I think it’s important to also think of who are the major stakeholders and how can they be represented. For Grin, we’ll likely have developers and general contributors, miners, users, investors (are they different from users?) and companies (like exchanges and web wallets). How can each of these groups be represented? How can we do so while keeping governance decentralized and protect everyone’s privacy?

I had a model in mind that addresses some of this but haven’t refined it very much. I’ll still throw it out there to see what others’ thoughts are. Imagine we have a “wallet” comprised of any number of signatory. To begin with, we can seed that with the current committers list (people who are the most involved). So each committer has a key and it requires a certain threshold of signatures to move funds. Now people can get added, either by votes of people who are already in that group, or by popular vote (for example). We could reach hundreds of people who ideally all care and all represent some point of view.

From here, the decision process, at least as far as how it pertains to funds deployment is a series of transactions. And maybe even for decisions that don’t entail fund deployment, a positive vote could just be whether an output was spent or not. The funding itself can be done by applying gentle pressure on miner and investor benefits (ala [@tromp](/u/tromp) fair mining license).

Of course, that still leaves a lot out (like what gets decided, how, what types of votes, etc.). Just throwing this out there to check what others’ think as well.

Thought I’d continue with a couple more ideas I’ve been playing with, hopefully some of them will elicit a reaction

1. We could take some inspiration from the Athenian democracy. To be nominated, someone needs to donate (directly or indirectly) a fixed amount of grins to a project fund. To vote, every grin user can somehow commit their holdings (a proof they have unspent outputs) to a nominee. We could perhaps have vote transfer by committing to a non-nominee who would then commit to a nominee. The assembly would then be the top N nominees by vote count. This is in the more “out of the left field” department and we’d have to think about Sybil attacks.
2. Piggyback on another foundation. I actually had some hopes the Zcash foundation would open up a bit but their last round of votes seems to have shut that down (41 over 23 voted to direct foundation efforts mostly toward Zcash). But we could check open source foundations for some of their legal help and handle funding separately. Perhaps something like the Software Freedom Conservancy.

[@lehnberg](/u/lehnberg) also pointed out this related discussion regarding Monero:

Thanks for sharing this [@igno.peverell](/u/igno.peverell). There are some of my randoms thoughts on it.

Reputation is one of the key components in a decision making process. It could be totally informal/subjective (“My name is Linus, and I am your God”) or very formalized (with ratings of any form including tokens). It’s a spectre of course, for example it may be binary (0 - no right of votes, 1 - one vote) which was described in your proposal of wallet and voters if I got it right. It could be number of shares. One of the questions of using some value token like grin as a project share is that it could be bought, not just earned, which may be fine in some cases btw. Less formal models don’t scale well but I prefer it and it very resistant to Sybil attacks.

Funding is important for new initiatives (Monero FFS sounds like a good way to achieve it) as well as for ongoing development. I see some companies like Parity started using Gitcoin to fix small or medium issues using bounty model. I’d like to see Grin project be truly opensource and not centralized around one (or few) companies like Zcash, but have to admit that compensation of developers is more tricky in fully decentralized case. From my experience is really important to have full time developers working on a project, part-time contributors could improve some isolated parts but could not make major changes. Traditional open source projects relies on corporates which use the project and hire developers, probably we could do better than that.

The most controversial part of course is making hard decisions, think of DAO or Parity hacks in Ethereum. Bitcoin was lucky enough to not be on the spot when they had to do such decisions, in case of Ethereum it was harder (however compare the reaction to DAO fork - “ok can you guys stop trading” and last debate on Parity funds when potentially less controversial decision was rejected by the community), in case of Grin one bad decision could kill the project because market is a bit more mature and expectations are higher now.

At least in the beginning I’d not build a complex formal system like <https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/wiki/Governance> but rely on some form of social consensus like in Linux (one downside - Igno will have to start insulting people in emails), however some more formal mechanism to manage funds because Linux did not have that problem.

There are a lot of topics and questions to cover, some are more important to tackle early, others can come at a later stage.

_How_ votes are conducted is something that can better be resolved once it’s clear _who_ is voting, and _what_ they are supposed to be voting on. And if there are any particular requirements surrounding the actual process itself. Will it need to support remote participation? Will it need to be privacy preserving? That sort of thing.

There will be trade-offs required, no matter the approach taken. In order to figure out how to make the right trade-offs and avoid them being subjective, biased, or arbitrary, it makes sense to have a set of basic principles, purpose, and objectives established to guide the project.

As these have not been written yet, how about we make an attempt to do that? Perhaps set a fixed deadline for completion, create a page on the wiki or a pull request, invite anyone and everyone to participate, solicit a working group to take a stab at writing the first draft, schedule all hands meetings in a dedicated gitter channel to discuss and debate, and then, once the deadline has passed, have the core dev team (i.e. the existing technocratic council, however these are defined) vote to “ratify” it, and then merge it?

Once there is such a document and it’s clear what it is that should guide the project, it then becomes easier to understand where to go from there. What do you think?

* * *

PS: Not only does The Main Programmer model not scale well, it’s also not particularly fault tolerant. Even if we decide to go with this model, a lot of things still needs figuring out surrounding how it works in the case of the main programmer disappearing, being hit by a bus, or simply becoming burned out. [What happened in the world of Python a few days ago](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-committers/2018-July/005664.html) is a good deterring example, I think.

PPS: Regarding foundations, I put together a wiki page weighing different use cases and approaches. [Please contribute/comment](https://forum.grin.mw/t/wiki-regarding-foundations/570)!

Chronos:

1 grin = 1 vote establishes a plutocracy. I’m not sure it is a desired end state to have the rich rule over the poor. Decisions often end up being seen as illegitimate in this structure, i.e. “The fat cats are just trying to deepen their own pockets”-style reasoning.

This is an attempt at summarizing the [governance discussion](https://gitter.im/grin_community/dev/archives/2018/08/07) (starting at 14:16) in today’s team meeting and structuring it into sub-areas, with potential decisions and work remaining. There may be small additions that hopefully stay in line with the spirit of the discussion. [@lehnberg](/u/lehnberg) [Regarding Foundations](https://github.com/mimblewimble/docs/wiki/Regarding-Foundations) document was used as a basis.

Please comment below after reading if you notice anything missing or erroneous!

# Policies

An important set of policies in blockchain governance has to do with the measures we agree to take (or not take) in case of disaster. This includes for example:

* A weakness in a cryptographic library or Grin’s usage of it that leads to arbitrary inflation of supply by an attacker (or miner).
* Quantamageddon.
* Privacy breach in Confidential Transactions.
* ASIC with 100x more efficiency than existing hardware.
* A bug in a wallet, or the grin wallet, that leads to significant loss of funds.
* Etc.

**Action Item** : someone to create a wiki page listing all main scenarios and possible remediations. A community discussion should ensue on grin-forum, on the wiki page and possibly on Gitter to see which solution(s) are acceptable (or unacceptable). Github issues may be created for some scenarios to address additional discussion and code-related changes.

# Legal & Liability

While no one has completely ruled out the need for a fundation, many of us seem to think it may not be needed or required.

Anonymity can be an asset to help shelter this project somewhat. In addition, there’s very little risk until Grin hits significant valuation (if it ever does). Nonetheless, some prior precautions are good to have, in particular:

**Action Items**

1. Point or summarize Warranty and Liability sections 6, 7 and 8 of the ASL as present at the root of our source tree in our public website(s) and resources.
2. Publish and update a high-level roadmap of development and communit efforts.

# Funding

We expect to rely on 2 different means of funding:

1. Project based fundraising, similar to what [@Yeastplume](/u/yeastplume) has [already done](https://grin.mw/yeastplume.html).
2. General donations from mining pools and operations to keep development funded, [@tromp](/u/tromp) [fair mining license](https://github.com/tromp/cuckoo/blob/master/LICENSE.txt), other businesses that realize a minimal share of their profits should be shared. We shall call this the Grin Fund.

The Grin project reserves the rights to advertize businesses and operations that redistribute some of their profits on the project’s website(s).

## Funding Use

While this point was debated at length, project-based fundraising doesn’t seem to be realistic as a panacea for all funding needs. For example, most of the mining community will not want to follow the project closely enough to be able to identify worthy projects and fund them appropriately as they arise.

Following this, the first medium (direct fundraising) has been identified as more adapted to fund developers and particular projects that can’t continue without reoccurring and upfront revenue. The second medium (Grin Fund) is more adapted for funding more generic needs like testing environments, bug bounties, security audits, engaging non-volunteer companies (i,e, web design, legal), etc, as funds are available.

## Grin Fund Logistics

A so-called technocratic council (as dubbed by [@lehnberg](/u/lehnberg), no point in masking the reality here) should be formed form the current set of Grin committers as reflected on the Github commit rights.The council can vote new members (specific process still TBD). The council (or perhaps a subset of it, to limit friction) owns a multisig address that holds the Grin Fund and decides how to allocate it.

The council should also decide on distributing excess funds to contributors in the Grin project. As measuring and assessing merit in each contribution is difficult to do fully objectively, the distribution will be done at the council’s discretion. It will be up to the council to decide on a fair and reasonable process to do so (including when distributing excess funds to council members).

There is widely expressed concern that the fund may become too large, causing conflicts and personal interests to arise. It should be the council’s responsibility to mitigate overgrowth with early distributions, while managing funds responsibly. There should also be a process for conflict resolution and banning from the council in extreme conditions.

**Action Item** : Igno to herd cats and get this started.

Also note that all the funding logistic was agreed upon as a “good first step” and is not intended as the end all be all of Grin governance and funds management.

# Author’s Footnote

Except for what will come out of the policy effort, none of this really expresses Grin’s community values and ethos. It’s a shame, but it’s the realities of annoying but necessary governance processes. So to make sure what matters the most doesn’t get lost to an external eye:

* The Grin team is more than ever committed to the development of Grin: a privacy-focused, scalable, minimal blockchain.
* Grin is a community-driven open source project. Everyone including you can participate.
* This group is open, respectful, friendly and welcoming. We will do everything we can to keep it this way.
* We all want to deliver the best cryptocurrency we can to help and serve users of all kinds, across the world.

Hello,

Very happy to see that the governance is shaping up.

Please find below some comments and personal notes.

Thank you,

Arthur P.

Policies :
Personal note: I understand that each case is different and so the process in answering the potential challenge would be different; however a set of general procedure to answer it might be interesting. It will lead to more transparency and potentially better reaction time.
I am not sure that thinking of all vector of attacks and their associated solutions will bring value relative to building the ecosystem: wallet, mining pool, educational content…One should only focus on the general/well known vector of attacks and limit itself to that.

Legal:
A foundation is a point of centralization and so a potential point of failure, however it can also bring a sort of focus to help support and potentially accelerate the growth of adoption by allocating fund in a more “efficient” manner. There is other point to that comment but this seems to be the main one.
Personal note: it seems to me that a foundation is a mean to end and depend on the vision that Grin wants to achieve. If it wants to be a bitcoin like ethos, a foundation might not be the way to go. I am personally not for the use of a foundation.

Funding and funding use and logistic:
Personal note: I really like this two ways as they are meritocratic focus. The only point is that it might be hard to compete at the begning with other more centralize parties like BEAM but in the long run I think it would be worth it.
Zcash as an interested model. They are trying to involve the community in curating different projects. Those projects can after be build by whoever. Other model can also be think about.
The logistic of the fund will be a breaking point as we have seen more than once in the ecosystem. It should be clear from the start and the process made public. One should be inspired by failed (in my opinion) attempt like Tezos, and EOS.

The ‘technomity’ is made up of entirely of people who’ve demonstrated through their actions that they’re eminently capable of contributing to the project and have undertaken to try to assist with the thankless task of project guidance. All of them have an extensive public record of Gitter conversations, Pull Requests, and comments in issues or the mailing list that anyone can sift through to draw their own conclusions. Forcing everyone on the team to answer questions such as ‘do you smoke meth’ or demanding insight into their political views isn’t just pointless, it’s downright insulting and demeaning. If somebody asked me anything like that on a job interview I’d stand up and walk out.

Nobody on this project is asking you for anything, nor will anyone be answering an arbitrary list of intrusive personal questions. If that’s not to your liking, I invite you to take the code, make your own fork and declare yourself Galactic Emperor of it.

### Post by @InflationsNotBad (2018-08-21)
*Post #1*

One of the most controversial features of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies in general is their deflationary nature. This feature is unique in that it’s more ubiquitous than proof of work, yet is in no way necessary to the protocol or security of the network and is completely arbitrary and arguably illusionary (as it can always be forked out at a later date). While among Crypto evangelists and many early enthusiasts it is considered one of the core tenets of cryptocurrencies, I would argue that it’s the asset’s biggest flaw.

While capping the supply of a coin may make it seem appealing as a store of value, ultimately it has detrimental and possibly debilitating effects on both adoption and use of the coin as a means of transacting. In addition even the basic function of a store of value is threatened by the fact that restricted supply limits do not properly incentivize mining, and as a result have allowed many existing coins to become incredibly vulnerable to attack. Grin’s position as both an extremely scalable and privacy focused coin make security, adoption, and utility much more central to its success than acting as a store of value. Thus I would like to propose that Grin adopt a protocol that allows miners to control the emissions rate up or down by some percentage every block.

In my experience, the problem people have with inflation isn’t the mechanism itself but rather who benefits from it. The way that inflation is implemented, in fiat currencies, tends to benefit key institutions and individuals with the benefits which only slowly trickling down. While cryptocurrencies were supposed to fix this; by allowing those who secure the network to benefit from inflation, with the assumption that they would have to sell the coins to pay for electricity and hardware; however evidence indicates this has caused even more centralization than we see in fiat.

Since I am proposing something that may be quite controversial and is certainly not well discussed in this community I accept that the burden of proof falls upon me. To this end I will spend a considerable amount of time explaining the factors that influence this proposal laying out the negative effects of deflation on adoption and utility, discussing and reviewing the security implications of deflation, both theoretically and on existing coins, and finally detailing what I propose.

In addition I would like to highlight the following articles in support of my arguments and as further evidence of how the current system tends to encourage hording, by miners and early adopters, as well as exacerbate the negative effects of deflation.

# Problems with Deflation

Whether a hard cap, like Bitcoin, or soft cap, like Ethereum, these caped inflation rates turn coins into extremely deflationary asset where eventually more coin will be lost per year than are created thus shrinking the total supply and exacerbate all the intrinsic problems with deflation exponentially, this will eventually leave such coins essentially illiquid, or perpetually unable to meet market demands for liquidity. In addition to the basic liquidity issues caused, deflation leads to a host of other problems including; making the first-in the best-off , as well as the rich richer, and disincetivizing use, while some of these issues have not been massively detrimental thus far and may have even helped increase early adoption, they are not necessary to the protocols and will disincetivizes further adoption compared to identical inflationary coins.

First off, the supply caps on crypto assets, whether soft or hard, coupled with the nature of crypto assets (the fact that wallets will be lost and/or coins burnt) mean that eventually these coins will have negative inflation rates. So what does this mean for the value of these coins? Well, while many people like to compare Bitcoin to gold, gold actually has a very consistent positive inflation rate on a percentage bases, averaging 1.55% over the last 12 years and gold production has grown relatively consistently over the last century. So if Bitcoin’s inflation rate isn’t comparable to gold, then what is a good comparison? Well there aren’t many deflationary assets for good reason, they become illiquid over time and thus can’t be used practically or transacted in freely. The closest (though problematic) comparison I can come up with would be a particular vintage of wine, which do tend to increase in price over time, as the total supply decreases, never the less the market for any particular vintage also shrinks until it eventually becomes completely illiquid in the hands of a small number of collectors. While many Bitcoin enthusiasts argue that this will not happen to Bitcoin since they can be broken down into infinitely small fractions, allowing the market to sustain liquidity, the problem with this argument is that it’s only true if we measure that liquidity using an inflationary asset such as dollars, the liquidity measured in Bitcoin will obviously be decreasing. So inevitable you are left with an ever greater number of people competing for an ever shrinking quantity of Bitcoin until it becomes unsustainable and something has to give, since the quantity of Bitcoin can’t increase the number of people interested in competing for it will have to give.

One thing that deflation does that has, thus far, been helpful to crypt is that it makes the first-in best-off, which has incentivized lots of people to buy in, with the hopes that they will be bought out at a later date, and has increased early adoption. However long term this is not sustainable as it would require that every new wave of adoption buy in at a higher price, and rely on the wave of adoption that comes after them for the value of their coins. Effectively this making the coin very similar to a pyramid scheme where finding the new actors to buy-in and bringing in the new stakeholders needed to increase the overall level of adoption becomes exponentially harder, since new stakeholders benefit exponentially less, thus making scaling the coin increasingly difficult.

This leads me to the first important benefit of inflation, which is to prevent the rich-get-richer effect where, without inflation, people who have money will automatically gain wealth by **not** investing it, while people who spend money will loose wealth even when they use their money to buy useful products. So whoever can go the longest spending the smallest percent of their wealth ends up the richest, and since the wealthiest by definition have the most wealth and thus need to spend the smallest percent of that wealth to sustain themselves the rich-get-richer. This obviously encourages people to stop; spending, making risky investments, or using their coins at all.

Thus lack of inflation disincentivizes adoption of the coin for its intended use, as the longer you can go without spending the coin the more it will be worth and the less you will have to spend giving rise to the HODL state we see in many coins. To illustrate this, let’s say someone has half their money in dollars and half in a coin and they have to pay for something, since there is a cost to acquiring the coin (conversion fees, time and effort, etc) they are better off saving the coin they have, since it will likely be worth more tomorrow, and using their dollars, which will likely be worth less tomorrow, to make payments. This means that the expected appreciation of the value of the coin, relative to dollars, is actually an additional cost that the user must pay to realize the benefits of the coin (such as privacy). However, were the coin to be inflationary at the same rate as the dollar then the user would have an incentive to always opt to use the coin, since they would achieve the benefits that the coin offered for free, and these benefits could even offset the costs of exchange encouraging the user to exchanging dollars into coins and then use the coin, when possible, instead of dollars. What this means is that while deflation may make the coin appreciate in value, relative to the dollar, this appreciation becomes a cost to transacting in the coin and is detrimental to the overall value of the system as well as adoption and use of the coin as anything other than a store of value.

# Spiral of Insecurity

Disincentivizing transactions has alarming implication on the security of the coin’s network, since this security is paid for largely by these transactions, this can and I believe will lead to 51% attacks becoming increasingly common on ever larger networks.

**Let me start by explaining the logic underlying PoW coins in general and what makes them secure:**

The security of the network is relative to the value of the network IE: If the market cap of a coin is $100 and there is $200 worth of mining occurring on the network, then you know it would be very difficult to profit from performing a 51% attack on the network. Now let’s say the market cap is $1,000,000 and there is only $200 worth of mining occurring on the network, now it would be easy to profit from performing a 51% attack on the network, for instance you could short the coin, then publicizing a 51% attack on the network allowing the value to tank, and/or spend it and then 51% the transaction to keep the coin, or do both. Either way the attacker should easily be able to recover more than the cost of the attack; so you can see that as the value of a coin increases the potential return from attacking it also increases. So, in order to keep the network secure, it must pay for people to mine on the network.

**So how does the network pay for its security?**

The security of the network is paid for in two ways; by emissions and transaction fees. As the emissions rate of a coin decreases, in order to keep the incentive to secure the network constant, the portion of the networks security paid for by transaction fees must increase. Meaning that as the emissions rate of the coin decreases, users must either choose between increasingly low relative levels of security or increasingly larger transaction fees, either from increased volume or from increased fees, to sustain the same relative security.

**So what does this mean?**

Driven by an increased expected future value of the coin and a decreased desire to transact in the coin, both caused by deflation, users will continue to prefer lower transaction fees over higher security, thus making the network increasingly insecure until there is a failure. This is to say that while gross transaction volumes will likely increase, absent technological barriers, never-the-less the increase in total transaction fees will not be proportional to the increased value of the coin.

In this way we can see that emissions/inflation allows for the security of the network to be paid for through the coin’s value. While any coin that doesn’t have an increasing emissions rates ultimately has capped its security relative to its value and the number of transactions on the network.

# Vulnerability to Attack

The security of Proof of Work coins is derived from the amount of work that is done securing the network. If a coin that has a market cap of $1,000,000 is only secured by $1,000 worth of equipment, then one could 51% attack it for $1,100. Meaning that if someone could obtain $1,100/$1,000,000=1.1% of the coin and spend it on mining equipment, they could 51% attack the network and theoretically get their coin back. So long as we look at this valued in coin, they would have risked nothing and acquired the mining equipment for free. Obviously this would not be true if we value it in dollars, but assuming they could sell the mining equipment at break even (possibly by pre-selling or mining with it before they perform the attack) then any value that the coin retains after their attack would have been made at zero risk. This means that anyone who can acquire 1.1% of the total supply has an economic incentive to attack the network. Obviously the higher this % the harder it would be for a single actor to acquire that amount of coin without incurring added costs (due to moving the price of the coin), thus the more secure the network, at 100% every dollar of value on the network is secured by a dollar of mining equipment meaning it will always cost more than one could make to attack the network.

(As of early August 2018)
So what does this look like for Bitcoin? Well Bitcoin’s current network hashrate is roughly 45,500,000 TH, and the cost of an Antminer S9 from Bitmain is $655 which produces 14TH. (note that I am going to use this number to measure the cost of attacking the network, in reality it would most likely be much cheaper as a attacker could most likely produce equivalent miners for a much lower cost.) So we have 45,500,000/14*$655=$2,128,750,000 of equipment on the network. Current market cap of Bitcoin is $141,182,470,188 so $2,128,750,000 / $141,182,470,188 =1.51%. **This means that if someone could obtain 1.51% of all Bitcoin (less than half the typical daily volume) and spend it on mining equipment, they could 51% attack the network and get their coin back.** This seems like it should be alarming to people who believe in PoW.

# The Trust Problem with Capped Inflation

The traditional capped or limited inflation rates require a tone of trust, which has clearly been entirely misplaced. In fact I think that trust, or rather trustlessness, was not even considered during the creation of the traditional capped inflation rate. The capped system gives Whales (mostly large miners and early adapters) complete control over the price of the coin and incentivizes these Whales to abuse this power as much as possible. We have already seen this lead to total increasing centralization of holdings resulting in massive trust issue within existing systems. Not knowing when Whales will dump or pump puts a risk premium on the coins and this is why so few merchants want to use existing coins and those that do charge a premium for using coins (vs credit cards) even though the coins are more efficient and should be cheaper than credit cards. You have to realize that merchants don’t want to hold the coins but rather want to use them to purchase more goods, so price stability is paramount to them.

How can anyone call an asset trustless when its value could fall 90%+ at any time, solely based on the whims of a small group of individuals. Hell, as pointed out in the article I posted above, Whales don’t even need to sell off their assets and can bring prices down substantially simply by moving their assets to exchanges. The problem isn’t powerful or wealthy individuals investing in crypto, the problem is that the system is designed to inflate their power and reward them for abusing it.

If we adopt MCEs inflation will encourage miners to sell off their coins as soon as they get them, allowing these coins to enter the market and be actively priced in. This means that the inflation will actually be felt by the market (this is very important and is not the case for existing coins who’s prices do not correlate with changes in their respective inflation rates). This means that anyone looking to hoard coins will loose value due to inflation and will incur a direct cost to manipulating the price. While the price of the coin in dollars will be based on actual demand for its use making prices much less volatile vs the competition.

# Introducing Miner Controlled Emissions (MCEs)

Miner Controlled Emissions (MCEs) is a relatively simple solution. The idea is to have an initial emissions rate per block and to include a field in each blocks that adjusts the emissions rate future blocks. This field could and probably should be limited to a very narrow range, depending on the block propagation rate, with the range being further restricted if blocks are produced faster. For example lets take a chain that starts with an emissions rate of 1 coins per block producing 1 block every min, and allows miners to change the emissions rate by between +0.0001% and -0.000101% per block. This would mean that in order to increase or decrease the emissions rate by 1% it would take 10,000 consecutive blocks voting the same way. This would allow miners to gradually shift the emissions rate to respond to market demands.

# TL;DR

MCEs would have the following beneficial effects:

1. Increase returns on mining, vs other coins, thus more miners would mine the coin making the network more secure.
2. Encourage miners to sell their coins, due to increased expected inflation, thus forcing coins to actually hit exchanges allowing the inflation to spread efficiently and consistently
3. Create some level of price stability, by creating stable inflation
4. Encourage people to use the coin rather than hold them
5. _Allow supply of the coin to meet demand such that Es (Price elasticity of supply) should tend towards 1 over the long term_

Due to Grin’s position as a scaleable privacy coin I would like to propose that it adopt miner controlled emissions.

_EDIT: Since each miner could increase the inflation rate by a percentage there would be no cap on the max inflation rate as inflation could increase exponentially. In addition miners could decrease the inflation rate logarithmically towards the natural rate of deflation caused by lost or burnt coins._

_Economically speaking miners would want to increase the inflation rate so long as the Price Elasticity of Supply is less than 1 (Es <1). If Es>1 then they would be reducing their profits, so this should cause Es to go towards 1 over the long term._

Thank you for the writeup and thank you for caring, unusual and well-argumented ideas are always a good read.

The main complication I can see is that calculating the elasticity of supply in cryptocurrency markets, that are dominated by speculation, would be extremely hard. Without having a good metric and a good understanding of it, miners are likely to just keep increasing.

InflationsNotBad:

> I agree that this is how individual miners will decide, but this is the definition of market demand, individual miners deciding to sell or hold based on the price and quantity they can sell and their own need for capital.

I don’t see why the desires of a handful of the largest miners would correspond to the needs of the market. If they’re hodling coins long term and acquired a huge stash, then they’d want to limit future emissions as much as possible, whereas the market might call for increased emission.

Waiting a decade for significant change seems too slow.

Most of your reasons are against capped supply, not against capped rate.
With linear emission starting from 0, Grin is already the most inflationary coin in existence, and getting lots of flak for it.

And your proposal does in fact cap the rate: “This field could and probably should be limited to a very narrow range”.

> Thus we would not be loosing anything except for simplicity, which is not reasonable to protect, economically, when we certainly don’t protect it technologically. Grin’s goal isn’t to be the simplest coin, but rather the best.

I just don’t see emission between say, 0.5 and 2 grin per second, depending on miner whim, being any better than a fixed 1 grin per second.

InflationsNotBad:

> please go back and look at what I am proposing in the OP.

I see; you’re not limiting the range of emission, only the rate of change.

In more discrete terms, over every 1,000,000 blocks, or 1.9 years, the miners decide to adjust emission in the range [emission / e, emission * e], where e = 2.71828…

While this is a reasonable way to do variable emission, I still believe that cryptocurrencies’ mission to avoid arbitrariness in emission is best served by a completely immutable one.

Just a couple of things:

tromp:

> While this is a reasonable way to do variable emission, I still believe that cryptocurrencies’ mission to avoid arbitrariness in emission is best served by a completely immutable one.

[@tromp](/u/tromp) How does this proposal make emission rates arbitrary? It would be controlled by miners through a voting mechanism with strict rules that are pre-defined and transparent to all on the network, similarly to how the consensus mechanism is. If anything, isn’t the current 60/sec a typical example of arbitrariness?

Ben:

> I agree completely. Putting it another way… if miners choosing their block reward is a problem, limiting the rate of change doesn’t solve the problem, it just limits the problem–at best.

[@Ben](/u/ben) I’m not sure I follow. The current proposal (as I understand it) is for a miner who mines an accepted block to have a chance to alter the emission rate for _the subsequent block_ by a fixed amount, let’s say it’s +/- 0.1% as an example. What are you suggesting instead? That the miner who mines an accepted block should have the right to alter the rate of the next block with -100% < x < infinity? How would that make any sense?

I don’t think the point is that ‘miners choosing their block reward is a problem’. What [@InflationsNotBad](/u/inflationsnotbad) is trying to do is to devise a mechanism that allows emission to be adjusted over time via the network itself, so that the network can find the right equilibrium of emission at a given time. Rather than just sticking an arbitrary rate in there, saying “we promise it’s the final rate and that we won’t change it”, and then praying it will prove to be the right one for the network, for all perpetuity.

In the context of what OP is trying to achieve, it then makes sense to have a fixed incremental step for the rate adjustment, so that miners only vote in the “direction” of the emission (should it go up or down), rather than the _actual_ rate of emission. The smaller the incremental step is, the more blocks (and therefore more miners) would need to vote in the same direction for a meaningful change to occur.

tromp:

> The grin emission is 1 per second which is arguably the simplest possible one.

I agree [@tromp](/u/tromp), 1/s definitely is simple. It’s also most definitely deflationary over time. Is that a good thing?

Ben:

> It doesn’t, nor does _arbitrarily_ limiting the rate of change. How are you determining best limit to the rate of change?

How do you determine the best constant emission rate? The difference between the two is that one has the actual emission rate practically set in stone. The other one allows for some flexibility and the network itself to adjust over time. Which one do you believe to have more tolerance for the initial rate being set incorrectly?

Ben:

> How is that determined? OP thinks there is some interesting game theory scenario between solo miners and pool miners to determine it. I think that is just wild guessing–and wrong based on past evidence.

What evidence are you referring to? Has this been done before?

tromp:

> I think what you mean is that it may not be inflationary enough, as it tends to 0% inflation.

…tends to 0% inflation, whilst expected loss rate of coins will probably remain fairly constant. At some point there’s an intersection where `loss of coins` > `new coins issued ` and thus there’s active monetary supply deflation. Or am I seeing this wrong?

Sure, this won’t happen any time soon, it’s more like 30 years into the future, and so perhaps it’s no issue kicking the can down the road. Personally I prefer sth that would work just as well in 30 years from now as it would work in 3 months from now.

That being said, there is definitely something really nice to be said about the elegance and simplicity of 1 grin/sec.

tromp:

> Allowing miners to change emission rate would lose this guarantee, as they can turn it into a finite supply by halving the emission every few years. I’m as opposed to that as to seeing emission double every few years.

Yes, that’s a real risk. On the other hand, a hard floor for emission rate could be set that’s >0% and that risk is then eliminated, is it not?

tromp:

> I want Grin to neither have a finite supply, not have more inflation than fiat. Linear emission is the simplest way to guarantee that, and I’m happy to see Grin being the first coin to adopt it.

To be clear, I’m quite happy for Grin to adopt it as well. Yet I do think that the arguments raised here merits discussion. I honestly don’t see what the problem of a high rate of increase of the coin supply is, as long as it’s benefiting the economy that uses the coin and discourages money being kept under the mattresses. Inflation is neutral, it’s a tool, its use being context dependent.

Update: this proposal was discussed at the last governance meeting, where it was preferred to stick with the existing 1 grin / sec emission rate as planned.

A suggestion was made for OP to pitch this idea to the Ethereum Research Lab for further studies of the mechanism design and game theoretic aspects, and see if some of the arguments can be proved to hold.

Over the past 6 months, it has become apparent to the team that:

* The availability of an ASIC for Cuckoo Cycle at launch is a distinct possibility.
* The current ASIC market is centralized, especially when it comes to recent cryptocurrency releases. The development of a competitive ASIC market takes time.
* A healthy and grassroot GPU mining community at launch is highly desirable.

After a significant amount of discussion, the Grin development team is proposing an update to its proof-of-work algorithm.

* Two proofs of work for the first 2 years (roughly): Cuckoo Cycle and Equihash.
* Equihash parameters are set to use around 7GB of memory, likely parameters are (108, 3). To avoid confusion with other parameters, we will refer to this as Equigrin.
* A multiplier is adjusted with the difficulty to maintain a constant ratio of blocks between Cuckoo and Equihash, on average.
* The ratio at launch should be 10% for Cuckoo, the rest for Equihash. This will smoothly transition to 100% Cuckoo over the next 2 years (roughly) by increasing the ratio by 1% every 12,000 blocks (about 8 days).
* If this solution is accepted, we will hard fork a tweak to Equihash every 6 months, with our planned hard forks, to deter stealth ASIC mining.
* After 2 years, Equihash will be abandoned and Grin will only have Cuckoo Cycle for proof-of-work.

Comments and thoughts are highly welcome! This will also be discussed tomorrow 8/27 at 15:00 UTC on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/grin_community/Lobby), during our governance meeting.

P.S. If you’re reading this and plan on mining or investing in mining on grin, consider contributing to the [latest funding campaign](https://forum.grin.mw/t/funding-campaign-yeastplume-oct-2018-to-feb-2019/677).

**FAQ:**

* _Why not just Cuckoo?_ Cuckoo as it is now is very ASIC friendly. In the early days of Grin and as its mining market matures, we cannot expect full reliance on ASICs. A grassroot upstart with a more open distribution is also closer the Grin’s ethos. Finally, a mature ASIC market is needed to minimize centralization.
* _Why not just Equihash?_ In the long term, ASICs can’t be prevented. We do not want to keep forking regularly, especially as the Grin mining market matures. Once only ASICs are profitable, Cuckoo is the simplest and optimal solution.
* _But Equihash already has ASICs!_ Mostly for Zcash and because the Equihash parameters chosen require little memory (about 140MB). Grin’s flavor of Equihash, Equigrin, should require at least 7GB. This increases the cost of ASIC production and obsoletes some of the larger GPU mining farms (i.e. NiceHash). In addition, we will tweak some Equihash parameters every 6 months to obsolete any ASIC development.
* _Why not ProgPOW instead of Equihash?_ For 2 main reasons: 1) Equihash remains a lot simpler 2) ProgPOW places an additional burden on proof-of-work verification making it less suited to light environments (cell phones, small VPCs, etc).
* _Why not Equigrin only for 2 years, followed by Cuckoo Cycle_ We do want a Cuckoo Cycle ASIC market to emerge gradually. This is the optimal (and unavoidable) long term option. The 2 years period should allow a gradual transition from a grassroot GPU market to a mature ASIC market.

[@opacey](/u/opacey) [@amamam](/u/amamam) we definitely thought about it. But it’s a far riskier approach, we can neither trust nor fully expect those manufacturers to come through. Any market upturn or downturn could drastically affect past commitments and our launch.

Re: Cuckooo memory requirements increase/randomness (for [@monkyyy](/u/monkyyy)), it wouldn’t be sufficient. The Cuckoo cycle lean miner has much lower memory needs (while mean sacrifices more memory for performance), so ASICs could be designed for Cuckoo32 and would be able to trivially do 30. Randomness wouldn’t change that picture, ASICs can figure that out just as much as a GPU.

[@opacey](/u/opacey) as indicated in the post, the memory requirement for equickoo should come up around 7GB. You can’t use the simple formula. For example Zcash uses (200, 9). The [@tromp](/u/tromp) solver can do it in 140MB, which is much lower than the theoretical figure.

Cryptonight(V2) is not intrinsically very ASIC resistant. It’s mostly tweaks to invalidate their current PoW and potential ASICs. The tweaks themselves make it only very marginally more ASIC resistant.

Return on investment in mining is typically calculated over 6 months to 18 months. Almost every coin I can think of would have a flat emission, just like grin, over that period. Also the ROI of a manufacturer is quite a bit shorter, compared to a miner.

It’s worth revisiting the original post of this thread.

No, that’s not right. As per the original post of this thread, The problem is the _degree of centralization_ and _lack of competition_ in the ASIC market, not the ASICs per se.

pomidorka:

> Cuckoo will/would give a fair distribution. For some time. Until ASICs are produced.

As per the original post of this thread, it is a distinct possibility that Cuckoo ASICs will be in operation by the time of mainnet launch. In that case, it’s also possible they would not be widely available to the general public. This can result in a significant degree of centralisation, at a very early and crucial stage of Grin’s lifecycle. It would be irresponsible to be aware of this risk and simply choose to ignore it and hope it doesn’t happen. The changes are introduced in part as a mitigation against this scenario.

The stated memory requirements based on 2-bit counters are incorrect, aince we only require counting up to 2.
So they’re really trits (ternary digits) requiring only log 3 bits.
An ASIC would pack 5 trits into a byte, with an atomic 2-bit update becoming an atomic 1-byte update.
cuckoo30 doesn’t need 128 MB for the counters, but only 4/5 times that, or 103 MB.

I consider this a weakness, and would prefer that an optimal ASIC design accesses single bits.

To that end I will later today propose a small change in the Cuckoo Cycle construction, that I hope everyone can agree makes Cuckoo Cycle even more ASIC friendly.

Originally Cuckoo Cycle was designed to make memory latency a bottleneck. Now, many years later, we realize that the SRAM that Cuckoo Cycle makes excellent use of (needing an order of magnitude less than the DRAM needed for efficient mining) is quite affordable in ASICs.
We expect ASICs to have a large efficiency advantage over GPUs.

Here’s the change in construction that allows replacing 2-bit counters by single-bit counters:

Instead of adjacent edges sharing an endpoint in the Cuckoo Graph, we require the two endpoints to differ in the last bit only.

This is a minimal change in the verification function, we replace
line 66 of cuckoo.c

if (uvs[k] == uvs[i]) { // find other edge endpoint identical to one at i

by

if (uvs[k]>>1 == uvs[i]>>1) { // find other edge endpoint matching one at i

and line 72

if (j == i) return POW_DEAD_END;  // no matching endpoint

by

if (j == i || uvs[j] == uvs[i]) return POW_DEAD_END;  // no matching endpoint

We also need to replace line 52

node_t xor0 = 0, xor1  =0;

by

node_t xor0, xor1;
xor0 = xor1 = (PROOFSIZE/2) & 1;

to fix early detection of bogus solutions. This has no effect on the distribution of cycle lengths in random graphs; a random endpoint is as likely to match another as it is to differ in the last bit only.

With this change, lean mining only needs a node bitmap to record whether it has any edge adjacent to it.
An edge then survives if the bit for its endpoint^1 is set.

Thus, a graph with 2^n edges will require 2^n bits of SRAM for full speed. It makes more sense to use this n in the name of the PoW.

Let’s call this new version Cuckatoo Cycle.

)/_
<' \
/)  )
/'-""

We will then denote by cuckatoo32 the problem with 2^32 edges
needing 2^32 bits of SRAM for full speed.
Compare with cuckoo32 that only has 2^31 edges but similarly needed 2^32 bits of SRAM (or 4/5 of that with trit packing).

So I propose that Grin uses cuckatoo32+ as main PoW instead of cuckoo32+.

This seems to make a lot of sense to me, it’s a very minor change and simplifies the memory layout conceptually and practically. What would the impact be on the mean miner? Would that become the default Cuckoo also from your repository?

Mean miner could use bigger buckets, since 48 KB of shared mem can now hold 2^18 counters instead of 2^17. That would be helpful for cuckoo31, since Nvidia apparently is much less efficient bucketing 2^13+ way than 2^12 way.
I haven’t decided how to deal with a pair of PoW in the repo yet.

It turns out that the expected number of cycles of length L on a graph of 2^n edges is slightly different, but in the limit as n->infinity it still converges to 1/L.

You replace the adjacency test

endpoint(edge1, side) == endpoint(edge2, side)

or its equivalent

endpoint(edge1, side) ^ endpoint(edge2, side) == 0

by

endpoint(edge1, side) ^ endpoint(edge2, side) == 1

Done.

Announcing [TMGOX.com](http://TMGOX.com),

aka Gringox,

aka The Magic Gathering Online Exchange.

[ tmgox logo draft2.jpg3000×1000 603 KB ](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex036/uploads/grin/original/1X/be6d0f8ec7cf27c0ee40339952664be169f63b09.jpeg "tmgox logo draft2.jpg")

In order to raise money for grin development when it is most critical (and well into the future) we are announcing _TMGOX_ , an online marketplace for all things cypherpunk. We have red hats that say MAKE ALICE GRIN AGAIN on them, and a mix of shirts, sweaters, bumper stickers, even a wall-mounted clock that is meticulously designed to tick-tock exactly synced to the mining reward rate of grin. Please check it out and tell your friends.

**100% of profits go to the Grin Development Fund.**

For the first time you can contribute to grin, which relies solely on donations, and get cool merchandise in exchange. We are adding new gear constantly, for example circular grin-smiley stickers for your laptop/wherever, and more styles and variations of everything designed by the grin community. If you would like to contribute designs, feedback, or ideas, please check out the transparency tab on the site for a way to contact us.

You can also get updates on our twitter @TMGOX.

Looking forward to growing with the network,

Happy Equinox,
Your resident cryptomancers,

Tom & Gus

aka 0xb100d

Newest updates and transparency report: <https://tmgox.com/2018/12/03/transparency-report-2-nov-30-2018/>

[ yeastplume-grincon0-slide1-1024x458.jpg1024×458 10.2 KB ](/uploads/grin/original/1X/f1c722c9d623a9408e7c02bd1b0f78a147ad7a83.jpeg "yeastplume-grincon0-slide1-1024x458.jpg")

Howdy y’all,

We are happy to publish our second [transparency report](https://github.com/0xb100d/TMGOX/blob/master/Transparency%20Report%20November%202018), announce [holiday sweaters](https://tmgox.com/product-category/holiday/) (order now to get them by the solstice!), and the book preorder of the first version of [GRINOIRE: a cypherpunk anthology](https://tmgox.com/product/grinoire-cypherpunk-anthology-book-pre-order/)! We have also fixed the flat rate shipping cost (we think) for stickers and other small accessories, please double check and let us know on [twitter](https://twitter.com/TMGOX) or via the [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/TMGOX/Lobby) if you are still having any issues. Because some people are ordering very far away and some are close we had to pick a happy medium to cover our costs and not have to calculate on an order by order basis, there was some error where this was coming out WAY to high, and we appreciate people pointing this out. All extra shipping costs that go beyond our expenses will also go directly to the Grin Development Fund, so don’t think that you are wasting money on the clumsy shipping prices.

[ grincon-limited-edition-stickers.jpg816×612 38.6 KB ](/uploads/grin/original/1X/2f19ce980697713dfad4f43c35b61b464d73150a.jpeg "grincon-limited-edition-stickers.jpg")

Also in sticker news, somehow all of our stickers arrived to Berlin for GrinCon0 well in advance of the shipment to our headquarters. If you ordered stickers we apologize profusely for the delay, please have confidence they exist and will get to you, and to make up for it we will be throwing in a handful of extras in your shipment. Right now our best estimate is that they will be going out the second week of December. That is more than a month delay for some of you, we are going to make it up to you!

First: check out our[ transparency report](https://github.com/0xb100d/TMGOX/blob/master/Transparency%20Report%20November%202018). We sold twenty-five things worth about two-thousand dollars! This is consistent with last month and we are eager to see the trend continue and hopefully grow. This resulted in a donation of .12777 BTC to the grin security audit campaign, or about ~$500 USD. So far everyone’s purchases have been making a significant impact and is a good sign that we will be able to maintain at least some level of consistent funding between campaigns. Once the mainnet launches and we see people mining grin and hopefully donating more to the development fund it will be interesting to see how the fund grows. In the mean time, please send us your ideas for new merch, and tell your friends. Recall many of these items are limited edition and won’t be available after the first planned grin hard fork. We are also looking at other suppliers to get our costs down so that we have more to donate to the development fund at the end of the day.

We were terribly honored to be given an entire slide in the very first talk at the very first [GrinCon](http://grincon.org) by the very first paid full time grin developer, yeastplume himself. We could not be more grateful to have a project as exciting and futuristic as grin to contribute our time toward, and are looking forward to many more years of support.

We are also looking forward to the first ever [US GrinCon](http://grincon.us), we are working with the Blockcypher team to design sponsored merch and other deluxe limited edition merch for the event at the end of January. If you are going to be in the area for that, please also don’t miss the [Stanford Blockchain Conference](https://cyber.stanford.edu/sbc19) happening in the days directly afterward. Bulletproof wizard and true cryptomancer Benedikt Bunz is one of the contributors and should be seen/heard in his glory at any opportunity you can get. Good opportunity to ask him what he thinks about grin, and bug him to publish all of his papers ASAP! (Don’t do this.)

[Holiday sweaters](https://tmgox.com/product-category/holiday/) are going to be the absolute coolset thing you can wear around this month, so please order yours ASAP so that it can arrive in time for the solstice Dec 21. If you wear one of these to grincon or the Stanford conference you may very well get a free sticker.

oops: <https://tmgox.com/product/supreme-mimblewimble-sweatshirt/>

Also very exciting, we are opening up the presale for the first edition of the [GRINOIRE](https://tmgox.com/product/grinoire-cypherpunk-anthology-book-pre-order/), an anthology of cypherpunk texts, key white papers, and other mumbojumbo, to help cover the costs of typsetting and printing, with all extra going to grin development fund, obviously. This very first edition is going to be funky, probably missing the sweet leather cover we were planning, and will leave all responsibility of navigating successfully up to the reader. But it’s going to be hundreds of pages long and the very first time many of the texts have _ever_ been physically printed. Please click the link to the book, and then in the description follow the link to the git of texts already to be included and please submit a pull request with any other related works you think should be included. This is going to be an awesome group effort, and will eventually result in an extremely slick and serious looking edition we can all be proud of.

[ grinoire-orly-1.png500×700 151 KB ](/uploads/grin/original/1X/e6003014f2275cc35e5aed63fbdf7f6dc9416ec8.png "grinoire-orly-1.png")

Note: this is at terrible mockup, but is probably something like what the first edition cover will look like.

We are consistently adding new merch and designs to the site, and the next couple will be a grin reaper tee as well as the yin yand one we teased last time. As always, please reach out on the forum or twitter or gitter if you have ideas.

Talk soon,

T&M

Never knew this site existed, what fun marketing! I was going to joke about tempting fate by raising the ghost of MTGOX, but that seems redundant now. Unfortunate I never got to pick up some merch, or check out the website.

Then again I never played Satoshi Dice. I never replied to satoshi in Bitcoin Talk, never transferred bank funds to Japan, and never bought weed on Silk Road. I never visited TMGOX.

I guess it’s best simply to say that TMGOX will always be part of the history; a history with records enshrined in Grin’s blockchain. Life just goes on.

Alice:

> Where have all the old people gone? There was a promising future at the start. but time goes by and there is no old flame.

Satoshi left Bitcoin and others came. Life just goes on. The old flames burn deep but the new flames bring change. This is true of Bitcoin, and it is true of Grin. Heck, it’s true of everything in Life, and blockchain. Do not ask where did the old people go, ask instead from where will the new ones come. For they will and I am proof. I could tell you my journey to Grin but that’s a different topic ツ

A bottle of whiskey would be required and I don’t drink that any more, if I can help it. A wince.

The journey is far too long and harrowing, littered with fist pumps and palmed faces, and the making and losing of fortunes. For a spell I was a columnist in the space (even wrote [an article about Grin](https://ggmesh.medium.com/the-wizard-and-marvelous-dr-maxwell-77a84dc51097), and even started a project to save knowledge (websites and digital files) using blockchain as an immutable database for its storage; creating a personal Wayback Machine. Worked with Larry Sanger and other interesting people. Even put a dictionary on a blockchain … and if you have to ask … Incidentally the project needs a bit of help so if you code lemme know. See [my bio](https://x.com/ggmesh) on X

The fillet of the long journey is that I discovered Bitcoin over a decade ago when MTGOX was operational and perhaps even before McCaleb sold it to that French guy with the frappuccinos. Then it all went to hell.

For those of you who remember those times, for me it felt edgy and anarchic. The greed had already begun to set in, true, but nothing like it is today. We were starting a revolution, or at least that’s how it felt. These days I shudder at what it has all become with bitcoiners courting regulators and dancing with devils. In the hubbub Saylor is heard barking at us to sell a kidney, maybe two …

Perhaps I could overlook it all if I could actually buy a beer with bitcoin, or any other crypto, and Im not talking about those VISA cards either. But sadly Bitcoin is an asset, a commodity, a new gold - Bitcoin is anything but an electronic cash system. Or can Lightning save us? Perhaps, but does anybody even care? Or has that new Solana shitcoin absorbing everybody’s attention?

For me Grin has some of that OG crypto vibe when we were changing the world and feeling good about ourselves for doing it. It was a long time before that was reflected in the price, or by the interest of others in discussing the topic.

Tromp and other oldies are still here, there’s a fortune in BTC split across two bodies, and huge potential … and sheeet, [it was 1.99 cents!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK8mJJJvaes)

The journey continues as just last month (it continues here more quietly by the way) when I was in Malta and met Adam Back and some other bitcoiners. I asked Adam about Mimblewimble and Polestra. I’ll share that in a new post under Technical Discussion soon.

Thanks for the question, after all.
