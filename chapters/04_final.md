# Chapter 4: Launch Day

At 6:48 PM UTC on January 15, 2019, the Grin genesis block was mined. The hash of Bitcoin block 558,994—mined just hours earlier—was embedded in the genesis data, proving to the world that no pre-mining had occurred. After two years of development, Grin was live.

## The Opening Hours

The first blocks came slowly, as planned. Igno had warned the community: "Don't be surprised if the first few blocks take an hour or two." The initial difficulty was deliberately set high to prevent anyone from stockpiling coins in the opening moments.

Within hours, the forum erupted with activity. Mining software developers raced to release optimized builds. Pools opened their stratum servers. GPU owners around the world pointed their cards at this new network with its unusual proof-of-work algorithms.

The numbers told the story of frantic adoption. By January 17th, just two days after launch, total network hashpower had grown from nothing to over 200,000 graphs per second. Within weeks, it would exceed 600,000.

Mining pools appeared seemingly overnight. Grinmint, which had supported Floonet testing, was ready for mainnet. F2Pool and Sparkpool—massive operations that mined multiple cryptocurrencies—added Grin support. Smaller pools like mwgrinpool served those who preferred decentralization over reliability.

The dual proof-of-work system created an unusual landscape. Cuckaroo29, the ASIC-resistant algorithm, dominated with 90% of rewards. GPU miners with 4GB, 6GB, and 8GB cards could all participate, though performance varied dramatically. A GTX 1080Ti achieved about 7 graphs per second on Cuckaroo29; a GTX 1060 managed only 3.2.

Cuckatoo31+, the ASIC-friendly algorithm, remained the domain of high-end hardware. Only cards with 8GB or more VRAM could attempt it, and even then, the memory requirements pushed hardware to its limits.

## John Tromp's License

Amid the launch excitement, John Tromp had a question for the commercial miner developers: "May I ask how you are complying with the license?"

Tromp's Cuckoo Cycle code carried what he called a "fair mining license"—a requirement that commercial software using his algorithms donate a percentage of mining proceeds to Grin's development fund. It was a clever mechanism: instead of taking a developer tax at the protocol level, Tromp had embedded the obligation in the software license.

Not everyone complied. When one miner developer promised to DM details about their compliance plan, Tromp waited. Days passed. "Nothing received," he wrote. "Please respond timely to compliance requests."

The exchange highlighted a tension that would persist: Grin had chosen to fund development through voluntary contributions rather than mandatory protocol fees. This required goodwill from miners, pools, and software developers—goodwill that wasn't always forthcoming.

## Early Disappointments

On January 21st, less than a week after launch, Igno Peverell posted a message titled "Early disappointments." It was unusually direct:

"Grin was started with as fair of a launch as possible for what's under our control. We did this for good reason: we believe in Grin's mission. I think I made pretty clear that to continue forward, the project would still need help. And yet Yeastplume's campaign is still very far from being even 10% funded."

The message wasn't aimed at the longtime community members who had supported Grin through its development phase. "This is directly addressed to some of the new funds, miners, mining pools and exchanges that have entered this ecosystem since the launch and benefited from it."

The numbers were stark. Professional mining operations were earning substantial revenue from the new network. Major pools were processing millions of dollars worth of transactions. Yet the developer funding campaigns remained largely empty.

"So please, forward this to those you think this message concerns," Igno wrote. "Perhaps a Chinese translation would be a good thing. Make everyone aware of our needs. We have a long way to go, this can certainly be fixed. And keep in mind that Grin will profit infinitely more from the contributions of a great developer like Yeastplume than from any single additional miner, exchange or fund."

Community members expressed frustration. "I know so many normal individuals who were so excited about this coin for so long and literally none of them are happy with the way things went following launch," wrote one. The concern wasn't about the technology—it was about the ecosystem that had formed around it.

## The Community Responds

The appeal worked. Within days, donations began flowing to Yeastplume's funding campaign. Sparkpool, one of the largest mining pools, announced a contribution. Individual miners pitched in what they could.

Grinmint announced plans to implement a fee structure: 2% for pool operations, plus an additional 0.5% dedicated to Grin development. It wasn't perfect—some argued the development share should be larger—but it established a precedent.

"Looks like you all decided to prove me wrong, I like it!" Igno wrote in a follow-up. "Thanks a ton to keepwalking1234 and Sparkpool, as well as everyone who pitched in after this email. This is very much appreciated and it looks like Yeastplume is fully funded for this new period, which is awesome!"

The episode revealed both the challenge and the strength of Grin's model. Without a treasury or foundation drawing mandatory fees, development funding would always require active community support. But when that support materialized, it came from genuine belief in the project rather than coercion.

## The First ASICs

Even before launch, ASIC manufacturers had taken notice. In January 2019, Obelisk—a company known for its Sia mining hardware—announced the GRN1, a Cuckatoo31 miner.

"Obelisk is excited to announce the GRN1, a cuckatoo31 miner," the announcement read. "We are looking forward to work with the community and targeting its ASIC friendly family of algorithms."

The announcement sparked debate. Some community members welcomed the validation of Grin's design—the dual-PoW system was working as intended, with manufacturers willing to invest in ASIC development. Others urged caution.

"Anyone considering this is cautioned to look at Obelisk's history of shipping ASICs way late and way below spec," wrote one skeptic. Obelisk's previous products had faced delays and underperformed their specifications.

Tromp provided technical context: the GRN1 would be competitive until April, at which point the weight of Cuckatoo31 would decrease enough that Cuckatoo32 miners—requiring more memory—would become necessary. "Beyond April the weight of CC31 becomes low enough that CC32 miners will likely out compete them."

This was the dual-PoW system working as designed. Memory requirements would increase over time, preventing any single generation of ASICs from dominating indefinitely. Manufacturers would need to continue investing in new designs, or their hardware would become obsolete.

## A Network Takes Shape

By the end of January 2019, Grin had transformed from a development project into a living network. Blocks were being mined every minute. Transactions were flowing. Pools and miners had established an ecosystem, imperfect but functional.

The challenges were real: funding remained precarious, the user experience was rough, and the transaction model confused newcomers accustomed to Bitcoin's simpler address system. But the core promise—private, scalable, decentralized digital cash—was now running on real hardware, secured by real proof-of-work.

The community that had built Grin in the open was now maintaining it in the open. The first hard fork was six months away. The work continued.
