# Chapter 7: The Hard Fork Years

Between January 2020 and January 2021, Grin executed three scheduled hard forks—the final three in its planned series. Each upgrade brought protocol improvements and tested the community's ability to coordinate. But the period was also marked by broader challenges: a global pandemic, difficult conversations about Grin's direction, and the beginning of a transition away from the founding team.

## v3.0.0: The Second Fork

On January 20, 2020, Grin completed its second hard fork at block height 524,160. Yeastplume's assessment captured the mood: "'Boring and uneventful.' Terrible review for your new Netflix series, but the highest praise you could possibly receive for your Hardfork."

The upgrade had gone smoothly—Floonet testing had worked, and mainnet followed without incident. But Yeastplume was already looking ahead, outlining priorities for the coming year: an interactive CLI mode for the wallet, better API documentation, improved testing infrastructure, and progress toward standardized offline transactions.

"Grin is markedly better than it was one year ago," he wrote, "and I fully intend to be saying something similar around this time next year."

## A World Gone Mad

By March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had disrupted life worldwide. Yeastplume's updates reflected the new reality: "World has gone slightly mad since my last update, and with a Yeastlair full of 7 people with varying degrees of neediness, some challenges have been thrown into my usual routines."

Development continued despite the disruption. The team focused on "compact slates"—reducing the data required for the first round of transaction building to enable new interaction methods like QR codes. It was the kind of careful, methodical work that improved the protocol incrementally but didn't make headlines.

"You most probably have greater worries at the moment than the state of a particular cryptocurrency," Yeastplume acknowledged, "but rest assured myself and everyone on the Grin team plan to keep plugging away as best we can."

## The Elephant in the Room

In late March 2020, a forum post titled "Let's talk about the elephant in the room" crystallized concerns that had been building for months:

"Bottomline is: Grin is an exciting project with fascinating tech that might fail to gain traction and become one of many dead ends in the cryptocurrencies world. What can be done about this?"

The post acknowledged the developers' hard work but raised uncomfortable questions. Big exchanges weren't listing Grin. New users weren't joining. The price had collapsed from launch highs. What made Grin different from countless other projects that had faded into obscurity?

Daniel Lehnberg's response, numbered and comprehensive, addressed the concerns head-on:

"Generally speaking, any proposal that's well argued, shows reason, follows logic, is full circled and is argued in good faith, seeking to discover some constructive improvement rather than trying to be right for the sake of being right or for the sake of inflating your own ego, I think will be at least *considered*."

On the general fund being held in Bitcoin rather than Grin: "The general fund being detached from Grin price fluctuation I think is a feature, not a bug... Look around at other projects, living and dying with the price of their coin. You end up being very short sighted, doing what you can right now to move the price, rather than focusing on stuff that makes sense in the longer term."

On sustainability: "At some point though, the funding will run out, and donations will dry up. It's okay. The project was literally broke and launched one of the most anticipated blockchains with $0 spent on protocol development... Unlike other projects, I think Grin will do just fine without any funding, we never even expected to have funding in the first place."

And for those who disagreed fundamentally with the project's direction, Lehnberg offered a sincere invitation: "Grab a few likeminded buddies, fork the repo, setup your own forum and keybase group, and there you go! Call yourselves Grin PRO, Grin X or whatever you like. If you follow the consensus rules, your node will be treated just like any node on the network."

## v4.0.0: The Third Fork

On July 16, 2020, Grin's third hard fork arrived at block height 786,240. The release introduced important technical improvements: compact slates that reduced transaction size, better Tor integration, and the deprecation of insecure API versions.

The secondary proof-of-work algorithm changed to CuckarOOZ—another iteration in the ongoing effort to keep GPU mining viable against ASIC development. It would be the last such change; after the fourth hard fork, the ASIC-resistant algorithm would phase out entirely.

## v5.0.0: The Final Scheduled Fork

On January 21, 2021, at block height 1,048,320, Grin completed its fourth and final scheduled hard fork. The moment marked an important milestone: the end of the planned upgrade cycle that had been announced before mainnet launch.

The secondary proof-of-work—the ASIC-resistant Cuckaroo family—began its final phase-out. Over the following months, its share of block rewards would decline to zero, leaving only the ASIC-friendly Cuckatoo algorithm. The dual-PoW experiment was drawing to its planned conclusion.

The hard fork also brought relative kernel locks—a feature that enabled time-locked transactions relative to their inclusion in a block. This laid groundwork for future features like payment channels, though implementing those features would require additional wallet work.

## Stability at Last

With the final scheduled fork complete, Grin entered a new phase. The protocol was stable. Users and miners could expect that the consensus rules they learned today would remain valid indefinitely. ASIC manufacturers could invest in hardware confident that their designs wouldn't be invalidated by the next fork.

The frantic pace of scheduled upgrades was over. The question now was what Grin would become without that forcing function—whether the community could maintain momentum and continue improving the project without the pressure of deadline after deadline.

The hard fork years had proven that Grin could evolve deliberately, executing complex coordinated upgrades without the drama that plagued other projects. They had also surfaced deeper questions about adoption, sustainability, and purpose that the next phase of Grin's development would need to address.
