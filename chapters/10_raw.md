As some have already noticed, Igno has not been very active over the past few weeks. He recently communicated to us in the council that he needs to be away from the project for a while for personal reasons. We do not have further details on his situation or a timeline for his return, but we anticipate he will be absent for at least a few months, possibly more. As Grin is open source and not reliant on any single person or group in order to progress, our work continues uninterrupted in his absence.

In his message to the council members, Igno stated that Grin was “in the best hands possible”. This was directed to the community as a whole. We have a long road ahead with much to be done. We individuals in the current council are as committed as ever to doing our part, putting in our best work, and moving Grin forward in the spirit in which Igno started this project. We look forward to Igno’s return, and, as always, invite you to join us and help us in making Grin the best it can be.

No, he was the third developer hired, and he did not write the whitepaper etc. He has however been very productive since he was acquired, and he will be missed. Both others will easily replace him. This whole thing seems like a FUD attempt with a lot of broken English - just sayin’

You’re incorrect. Ignotus was the originator of the Grin project. The MIMBLEWIMBLE white paper was written by Tom Elvis Jedusor and no-one except themselves knows if they are one and the same person or not. Yeastplume was not involved until a bit later although Yeast was the first paid dev. on the project. That may be what you are referring to.

As a general point, why not leave it to the Grin technocratic council to clarify matters around this event as they see fit? They are the people with the accurate information on this. Also, the project has been marked by a desire for honesty and integrity since its inception. So why not take the council’s statement at its word about Igno’s reasons for taking a hiatus? I would be inclined to wish him/her/it the best and hopefully they get a positive resolution to whatever they need to sort out.

Hi Sirius, just to correct the facts. Ignotus is the creator of Grin and started the project himself (as you can see on Github) on October 20 2016. This is sadly true and not a “FUD” attempt.

Am I missing something? Why is everybody leaping to the conclusion that Igno is gone for good?

> He recently communicated to us in the council that he needs to be away from the project for a while for personal reasons.

Life is complicated. Terrible events can occur and come seemingly out of nowhere, loved ones can get sick or, god forbid, pass away suddenly. Really, there are dozens of reasons why Igno might actually need to take time away from a project like this for personal reasons, as suggested.

As I understand it, Igno was part-way through some fairly significant and self-directed developments, like I2P. It doesn’t make a lot of sense for him to just up and leave, simply to do a “Satoshi”. So, my guess is that OP is accurate: he needs to take some time away for personal reasons. I’d be quite surprised if that’s the last we hear from him.

That was a release I did earlier today, that always come up as being from Igno’s account for some reason… I actually had a moment of hope when I saw a ‘mail from Igno’ email after doing a build, but realized what it was shortly after.

It has been a few months now since our founder Ignotus Paverell handed over the project to the Grin council and community. I’m sure many of you remember this day as a day of sadness (myself included). Ignotus possessed two characteristic qualities that’s rare to come by:

* Spirit to face challenges head on, irregardless of how daunting it may appear
* Belief in the good of others especially this community. Whom he made every effort to welcome to as family. He never once looked down upon any member of this community and always encouraged everyone regardless of skill-set or background to take part in the project without fear repercussions or ridicule.

Although he is no longer here, he has left within each one of us his most prized qualities. His spirit and belief. In essence we are all Ignotus. As a testament to Ignotus, members of this community have begun to sign off their posts with “**I am Ignotus** ”. A befitting reminder to a person who has given us his absolute best.

Agreed. It is a _little_ disingenuous to state that “members of the community” are doing this by the _sole_ person in the community so far doing this.

I think this might have gone down better if you had simply stated what you were doing personally.

As some one that has signed off as I am Ignotus on a post before I feel your criticisms also fall on me.

I love that line and I would be proud if we could all say this or have it as a creed.

YES I KNOW THAT IGNO IS NOT DEAD.

I feel this is similar to the I am Spartacus reference. I did not think that reference would need to be explained.

The people that said I am Spartacus did so not because he was dead (in fact the opposite was known to be true) but did it to protect his identity and to stand up and show support for him and his vision.

Please don’t throw shade at people using this as a forum sign off when a T-shirt with the same words exist and has been worn by more than a few in the community.

Personal opinion - this would have been more effective if people had just started doing it rather than making some big announcement that people we now doing it (by the people doing it).

The original t-shirt was really effective because everyone simply wore it. It wasn’t really talked about.
Almost the exact opposite of this.

To be clear - I’m not throwing shade on using this a a signature. I’m commenting on the fact that nobody needs to make a big deal of it and announce what they are doing (and imply its a big organized effort by the wider community).

### Post by @lehnberg ⭐ (2019-10-27)
*Post #1*

## tl;dr

The Grin developers are putting together a roadmap for the next year. You can take part in shaping its direction by sharing your thoughts in writing. The process looks like this:

1. Members of the Grin community write about what they’d like to see in Grin’s development during the course of 2020 by **November 10** ;
2. The core team reads these and considers them as it puts together a roadmap RFC proposal;
3. The proposal is presented and discussed at [grincon1](https://grincon.org);
4. There’s discussion, iteration, and eventual acceptance according to the [usual process](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin-rfcs/blob/master/text/0001-rfc-process.md);
5. This RFC then guides the work and improvements that become prioritized in 2020.

## Share your vision for 2020

### Write a blog post

From today and until **November 10** you have a chance to write about what you think the roadmap should contain. You can use whichever online writing method preffered, as long as it’s public and visible to others, for example:

* a post on this forum;
* a github gist; or
* a blog post.

### Covering any Grin topic

We’re asking for ideas and suggestions in a wide set of areas:

* Node or wallet features;
* Documenation improvements;
* Tooling suggestions;
* Governance iterations;
* Ecosystem activities;
* Community ideas; or
* Anything else Grin related you’d like to happen in 2020.

Motivate your suggestions, and try to share holistic proposals that can act as “stretch goals” for the community to pursue.

### And share it with the community

* Link to it in thread here on the forum; or
* Tweet it with the hashtag `#grin2020`; or
* Email `daniel.lehnberg@protonmail.com`;

We look forward to working with the community to set an agenda for the next year. Thanks for what’s been a great launch year thus far!

I for one would welcome more discussion about BLS signatures in general, and about the ideas that GandalfThePink proposed in the paper you refer to. [0]

With regards to the RFC, I was thinking where BLS signatures and where the “Grinsecure” nightly experimentation chain that [@yeastplume](/u/yeastplume) had proposed belonged in the context of a 2020 Roadmap. Even if I welcome exploring both these ideas further, I couldn’t come up with a solid argument as to why this should be a priority for 2020, over stabilisation, quality of service, and developer usability improvements.

In addition, BLS is in the process of being standardised, and it might make sense to wait until this has happened and there are more mature libraries for us to use. I’m not sure.

Generally speaking about BLS, it is promising _for sure_ , but the benefits do not come for free. New hardness assumptions would be introduced, we might lose ability to do adaptor signatures (although there are some ideas around that too), and there’s an upgrade and rollout mechanism that is yet to be defined. For me personally, it’s difficult to reason about whether it makes sense to introduce this or not without a more concrete plan and an evaluation of the pros and cons.

If we think exploring this is a priority for 2020, then there is arguably a lot of work around planning, design, and consensus building to be done even _before_ there is a library that we can integrate.

Where do we start? What is a “good” step to have as a bullet on the roadmap? A BLS RFC proposal? What do we think is reasonable to achieve here by the end of the year?

tromp:

> So what is the main pro?

In terms of **pros** , it’s been said that supporting BLS signatures would enable:

1. Transactions to be created non-interactively, i.e. no communication between sender S and recipient R required for a valid transaction to be built;
2. All transaction kernels (moving forward from that point on) to be aggregated into a single kernel.

In terms of **cons** , I understand that:

1. Additional hardness assumptions would be added so that Grin would no longer have the same security assumptions as Bitcoin.
2. Adaptor signatures (scriptless scripts) would not work with BLS. Even if there are efforts to figure out how to support this, they have not been confirmed to work yet. This means things like atomic swaps and lightning-network style scaling on L2 might not be possible in the future.
3. There’s added complexity in terms of supporting two signatures (Schnorr + BLS), there’s added effort in terms of building/integrating a BLS library where there currently is no standard, and added risk in terms of getting something wrong in the implementation process where there’s not been an implementation in production yet.

In addition, there’s an open question in terms of how to best introduce the signatures and (any) migration process. A turnstile approach has been mentioned in the past, but I don’t think there’s been an actual proposal yet for how this would work in practice.

What else is there in terms of pros/cons/questions that I’ve failed to include above? For the record, I don’t think it’s been established yet whether the above claims are factually correct.

I think item 2 is misleading. A kernel consists of several parts: a public excess, a message (usually including a fee, and an optional lock height), a nonce commitment, and the actual signature scalar.

With BLS there are no nonces, and the signature scalar becomes a signature curve point.

Even with BLS, one still needs to store all the public excesses (i.e. public keys), and all the messages. For each unique message, one can then aggregate their signature curve points into a single one.

Overall this appears to be at best a small constant factor reduction in size and processing.

lehnberg:

> Was it ever established to what degree transactions would be non-interactive under BLS?

Assuming we don’t want to put additional data on-chain, you might be able to reduce transaction building to a single trip, i.e. S->R instead of S->R->S, but not better than that. We are still limited by the bulletproof, which can only be generated by the receiver.

Neo:

> It seems like no one in Grin core/ any active dev is confident they could design/ implement a BLS solution.

I think the main question right now is if at our current point in time it would make sense to dedicate our limited resources to BLS.
Grin has been relying only on “established” cryptography, based on ECDLP. Using BLS would be a significant departure from that, pairing based crypto is less mature and “battle-tested”. In addition we would have to indefinitely support 2 crypto libraries simultaneously that use different curves and devise a way to allow users to transfer between them.

Edit; oh i see daniel already did a good job of summarising the downsides

---

### Post by @Yeastplume ⭐ (2020-01-20)
*Post #47*

Not going to be saying much new here, but just going to summarise my understanding and position on any potential BLS signature research.

First, I think we need to split off consideration of the Pink Paper for the time being and set it to one side. It is definitely of value and of it does indeed outlines exciting possibilities, but it’s still an unreviewed proposal based on a theoretical foundation (e.g. a Grin or Grin-like chain that already incorporates BLS) that doesn’t currently exist. I’d see it as an potential example of something that might be enabled by Grin+BLS, but designing or planning to it right now is putting the cart several miles before the horse.

That foundation is what we’d be looking to establish via any BLS research we’d be undertaking at this time. As has been said before (but I’ll outline for the purpose of my point,) the immediate implications of changing the underlying cryptography to a pairing-friendly curve and incorporating BLS are:

* ~~The ability for a secure single-trip (A- >B) transaction creation that doesn’t leak private keys. (This is actually possible today if participants are willing to expose their keys to the other party). The main advantage BLS gives over Schnorr is that no exchange of nonces is required among all parties before the partial sigs can be created, enabling the A to include a partial sig in the transaction sent to B. That’s really about it~~. edit: (Not without further research on how to construct this, see thread below)
* Being a step closer to kernel aggregation, (but not all the way there)

That, in my mind, is it for the time being. Incorporating BLS will not magically give us ‘non-interactive transactions’, (though it may facilitate future schemes that can try to emulate them,). It could remove some friction from the transaction creation process, a not-insignificant benefit.

However, the main downsides of trying to bung this into Grin as it stands are many (and have all been stated before):

* Having to maintain 2 separate crypto implementations
* BLS requires the use of pairing-based cryptography, which is immature as a field of study and very immature in terms of usable implementations, which means massive risk for anyone relying on them for secure applications. It would be highly irresponsible of us to suddenly expose all of the value locked up in Grin in this manner.
* Having to reconcile pairing-based outputs with secp256k1 outputs (the whole foundation of MW is summing outputs together, and you can’t meaningfully sum elements across 2 separate fields) I can’t even begin to imagine how we’d deal with that.

On balance, I don’t see the immediate benefits (slightly easier transactions, slightly slimmer kernel set and only nebulous possibilities of future benefits) being worth this pain and risk exposure for all Grin users.

If I were to start a Grin+BLS research project right now, what I would be doing is forking Grin and replacing the underlying crypto primitives with the most mature paring-based curve implementation available. (This in itself would be a very time-consuming and resource intensive project, don’t forget all of the work that’s gone into implementing the MW primitives on top of libsecp256k1.) Then I would be replacing the current transaction-building protocol with a single-trip A->B protocol based on BLS.

I would not even attempt to think about how to incorporate all of this into Grin at the outset, and would be exclusively focused on a new testing chain that only uses bleeding-edge and largely untested and unhardened paring-based crypto. I would thus call it ‘Grinsecure’, because nobody would have any idea whether it’s supposed to be more secure or less secure than Grin, which would accurately reflect reality.

This would be entirely, 100% a ‘Grin Labs’ (n.b. this doesn’t actually exist) research project intended to explore pairing-based crypto, the possibilities enabled by BLS signatures, and not in any way intended for use as a new currency or ‘Grin 2’. As I said, trying to bung untested-crypto into Grin for some small and less-then-tangible benefits would be grossly negligent toward anyone who’s put any value at all into Grin.

Perhaps would-be fork authors should take note: instead of forking Grin and changing the economics, try forking Grin and changing the underlying cryptography in this manner, then you’d be adding something of great value from a research perspective that the community could get behind (even though you’d be putting users at great risk if you ever tried to launch an actual currency).

But for now, what I’ve just described is as far as I’d be willing to advocate for exploring BLS currently. Whether this is worth it given our limited resources is hard to say. If we were a corporation with an Advanced Research department, it would be a no-brainer, in our situation, it’s not such a slam-dunk.

## Funding Proposal: PIBD implementation in Grin++
*Date: 2025-01-28 | [Forum Link](https://forum.grin.mw/t/funding-proposal-pibd-implementation-in-grin/11583)*
*Importance Score: 78.6 | Core Participants: davidtavarez*

# Funding proposal PIBD implementation for Grin++

This is the start of Funding Proposal to implement Parallel Independent Block download (PIBD) [[REF](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin-rfcs/blob/master/text/0022-pibd-deployment.md)] in Grin++.

## Why invest in implementing PIBD in Grin++?

The motivation is quite simple. Grin nodes consist for a large part, let’s say around 50%, of Grin++ nodes. Currently Grin++ uses the “. Zip” method to download chain data. There are numerous issues with using zip files such as a) being centralized, b) being vulnerable to attacks, c) easily leading to corrupted or failed downloads, in which case you need to download the whole file again and d) creating zip files requires a lit of memory and cpu recources, making nodes very busy and unavailable, often leading to them being banned because of becoming not responsive.

The grin rust node has switched to using PIBD which is more robust, decentralized and with some further optimizations could easily become a much faster syncing method than downloading zip files from a single peer. This was proven by MWcoin which can sync their chain in 11 minutes with a slightly modified PIBD version [[REF](https://forum.grin.mw/t/mwc-coin-claims-they-significantly-increased-node-sync/11476)].

## What is a Funding Proposal?

Some of you might be familiar with Funding Requests by developers but might wonder what a “Funding Proposal” might be. A Funding Proposal is roughly the same as a Funding Requests, but it is initiated by the community or a council, which means it is less of a hassle for developers since there is no question anymore if there is interest to fund implementing a certain function, the only questions to discuss are practicalities like the _exact deliverables_ , _estimate time_ for delivering these deliverables and the _amount of funding_ that is appropriate.
Input from developers is very useful here. Grin rust has PIBD implemented and good documentation exists for PIBD which make implementation easier. However, many optimizations have not been implemented yet in grin rust node. It would be forward thinking to consider the need of a few optimizations in implementation in Grin++ and perhaps put some first optimizations in the deliverables. That might mean some small changes or additions in the existing PIBD messaging are needed.

## For who is this Funding Proposal meant?

Although this is an open call, the main idea is to invite [@david](/u/david) and [@davidtavarez](/u/davidtavarez) as maintainers of Grin++ and ask if they are interested in taking on this large but important next step in the development of Grin++.
Your input on exact deliverables, how much time you think would be need and appropriate funding, would be examples of valuable contributions to this discussion.

## What do we need from community members?

First of all, we discussed this topic shortly between CC members but I would like to invite them formally to give their endorsement and input on how to shape this Funding Proposal:
[@Cobragrin](/u/cobragrin) [@Neo](/u/neo) [@renzokuken](/u/renzokuken) [@trab](/u/trab) [@Trinitron](/u/trinitron)
Also from community members, it would be good to know if you support this initiative and if what you think would be needed to make this endeavor successful.

## Pitfalls

We have consider that in the past some of funding towards Grin++ did not lead to a permanent fix. For example, a fix for "no peer " issues was funded before, however this issue persists although for only a few users. It is therefore important to clearly define our deliverables, perhaps put funding to certain deliverables and for developers it is important to inform as early as possible if some unforeseen bottlenecks are encountered that would for example mean deliverables cannot be achieved and perhaps more time and funding are needed?

## Deliverables

[_Below a list deliverables and update deliverables based on feedback from everyone, below some initial thoughts_]

1. A working PIBD messaging implementation for Grin++. Nodes need to be compatible in their messaging with other peers like grin Rust nodes.
2. A permanent fix to Grin++ nodes mostly connecting to other Grin++ nodes. Probably due to lack of PIBD support for Grin++ but perhaps as well due to different peer banning rules, currently Grin++ nodes mostly connect to other Grin++ nodes. In a dystopian world this could break decentralization and lead to sub networks of grin nodes. Therefore, this issue needs to be investigated and solved to avoid it ever from happening. It should be to difficult ones PIBD has been implemented.
3. Some first optimizations, perhaps asking for a list of fragments, or just increasing default segment size. The challenge is that any improvements should not break compatibility with other nodes such as grin rust nodes that not yet have these optimizations implemented.

## Funding amount

yes, PIBD is slowing down initial sync up to 24 hours with slow peers, waiting time for every sync step is increasing.

g++ has known problem with peers, banning rust ones, I guess this bug should be fixed before pibd implementation.

It would perhaps make it easier to implement optimizations to grin rust node since optimizations are already getting tested in Grin++. And yes, grin rust nodes and as such Grim nodes will always benefit from more peers that support PIBD, even ignoring possible optimizations.

I am mostly looking for lowing hanging fruits regarding optimizing the speed of PIBD, e.g. _**increasing default fragment size**_ for request, perhaps a call to ask for a list of fragments with a single hash to check etc.
Regarding slow and fast peers. I think the code in Grin++ could aim towards getting a response with a certain amount of time per peer. Meaning, if the response from Peer A is slower than a maximum response time over the last 10 calls or failed due to time out, the fragment size to be requested for that peers can be decreased by a factor 2. Is peer A faster than minimum a threshold for response time in the last 10 calls, the fragment size can be increased by a factor 2 for that peer. Keep tracking of something like that is super easy, a structure per peer which contains session settings and statistics provides enough information to make the syncing smart and adjusting. In this way you get _**auto-tuning of the sync speed per peer**_ without it leading to any issues since there are no assumptions on whether a peer is slow or fast, it is a real time adjustment to what sync speed is observed. The only think that I do not know is if the messaging system as implemented right in the grin rust node supports different fragment size requests. So implementing it in grin rust might still involve quite some work depending on how it is implemented right now.

not sure what kind of optimization you are talking about, but cooperative work is needed 100%, so we can fix Rust node faster and with proper testing as we made some fixes back at 2023.

Anynomous:

> auto-tuning of the sync speed per peer

slow peers can be disconnected manually and automatically, we just need to find a way to detect them, I will make a patch of `grin_p2p` crate for Grim GUI with these experiments as now we have no external control on p2p server outside node.

There is another frequent issue like disconnection at background on Mobile when internet is going down and so on. After better testing we can push changes `grin_p2p` crate under _mimblewimble_ organization.

As I read this so far it’s an idea to fund PIBD implementation in Grin++. Correct me if I’m not caught up or that’s incomplete.

I weakly and vaguely support the specific goal of PIBD in G++. I don’t think it would turn away or attract any users, it works ok enough without it. It would depend on the amount and agreement from DT.

If DB was coming back to work on it though, I’d pay whatever fee he was asking for any task. Not for G++ specifically but just anything to get his specific mind on Grin again even just for a bit I think would be fantastic for Grin.

I think it would stop things like this from happening (correct me if I’m wrong [@Anynomous](/u/anynomous) I’m not sure if PIBD would solve the below issue exactly)

But it reSyn tx states from 0%, after about a hour, it reach to 99% and enter step 3/7. A few seconds later return to 2/7 with 0%. Griners, have any suggestion. Do I have to delete all the data everytime?

I regularly see forum posts about not being able to complete a sync or it taking super long. Which is odd to newcomers because Grin is supposed to be minimal and light.

## Let's Talk Privacy: Mimblewimble vs. Confidential Transactions

Specifically Blockstream’s **Confidential Transactions (CT)** transactions in the Liquid Network. [This article](https://blog.liquid.net/guide-to-confidential-transactions/) explains CT.

[Screenshot-2023-03-16-at-10.43.571600×795 218 KB](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex036/uploads/grin/original/2X/c/c1133fc825d72b75bd6ab4c5eb713cba04196dfd.jpeg "Screenshot-2023-03-16-at-10.43.57")

My lager imbued meeting with Adam Back and other bitcoiners in a sushi restaurant in Malta a few weeks back gave me the opportunity to ask the cypherpunk all manner of questions, including what he thought about **Mimblewimble (MW)**.

Adam compared MW privacy to CT, giving me the impression he thought they were more or less the same, and then (IIRC) mentioned something about the former using range proofs whereas the latter uses signatures. To balance my excitement he also mentioned the large MW transaction sizes (in bytes) after I espoused the blockchain trimming cut through stuff which MW offers.

Transactions graphs also came up, these being bad for privacy, as did the obfuscation of transaction amounts; in this context I mentioned MWixnet which I don’t think Adam had heard of.

Fortunately, Adam is familiar enough with MW that my inarticulate phrasing of technical questions was well understood by the English mathematician. He understood what I was saying even though that was not always the case with tables turned.

We spoke of Poelstra at this juncture; the hirsute cryptographer who works at Blockstream but also rewrote the MW paper, and was the first person to react to Tom Elvis Jedusor’s publication of the original MW whitepaper in bitcoin-wizards IRC. But I digress from this topic.

So here are my questions for discussion:

1. How similar is Mimblewimble to Confidential Transactions. What advantages do they offer over each other, on paper and in implementation (i.e. Grin vs Liquid)?
2. Could transaction sizes become a problem for MW / Grin?
3. How to solve transaction graph breaking privacy and how is this handled in Liquid Network, if at all?
4. Privacy coins are banned from most exchanges, but should Grin be on that list if MW offers similar levels of privacy to Bitcoin’s Liquid Network?

Apologies if these questions have been addressed before, but in the event perhaps some succinct recaps would be useful to others besides myself. I’ll DM Adam with a link to this forum post in case he’d like to chime in and/or correct my recollections, thanks!

Privacy is a human right ，Privacy coins a guarantee of freedom
If the government prohibits privacy coins due to privacy concerns, it is illegal for the government; If the legislative body legislates to prohibit privacy coins, then this law is an evil law that violates natural law.
People have the right to resist such laws.Supporting privacy coins is a rebellion against authoritarian governments, just like the society in Orwell’s 1984 and Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World
Most exchanges dare to break the law for profit, Binance and [Gate.io](http://Gate.io) are not fully legal in China and are also illegal in the United States, but they are profitable businesses for coin exchange, so there are still many transactions.
The reason why the exchange removed privacy coins is because there are not many users of privacy coins,If there are as many privacy coin users as Bitcoin users, the exchange will not easily remove privacy coins.
greetings to Adam Back , who is very famous in China with the spread of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.

隐私是一种人权，隐私是自由的保障
如果政府因为隐私而禁止隐私币，那是政府违法；如果立法机构立法禁止隐私币，那这种法是恶法，违反自然法的法律。
支持隐私币，就是反抗极权政府，如同奥威尔《1984》和《美丽新世界》中的社会

I’d be remiss not to whip out the mimblewimble paper which goes into these specific questions:

1. See MW and CT in this chart [1].
2. Not much for Grin since historical txs only take ~100B on chain.
3. Handled with MWixnets on Grin, not handled on Liquid.

## Resetting the Community Council (CC)? -> update: new Grin Governance Council was created (GCC)

# 4 years of Community Council - time to reflect

It has been 4 years ago that the community and Original Council decided to kick-start a new council specifically to represent the interest of the community using its own separate fund. It has been quite a ride! We had our ups and downs and of course our fair share of drama.
Most originally appointed Community Council members have since a) stepped down or b) became less available and involved in Grin as project. We solved these issues by transferring one of the keys to a new owner (paoky → [@Mokhtar](/u/mokhtar)) and in other cases the CC members stayed on as key-holders only available for signing while new community council representatives represented them on a day-to-day basis as CC representatives. To give you a picture of the current setup of the CC, its key-holders and representatives see the overview below:

## Current CC key holders and representatives (4/6 MultiSig)

1 [@Paouky](/u/paouky) → [@Mokhtar](/u/mokhtar) → [@Cobragrin](/u/cobragrin) (representative)
2 [@davidtavarez](/u/davidtavarez) → [@trab](/u/trab) (representative)
3 [@mcm-mike](/u/mcm-mike) → [@renzokuken](/u/renzokuken) (representative)
4 Mac/[@Neo](/u/neo)
5 [@Anynomous](/u/anynomous)
6 [@hendi](/u/hendi) → [@Trinitron](/u/trinitron) (representative)

Of the above members _[@Mokhtar](/u/mokhtar)_ indicated he wants to fully step down and transfer his key and [@Neo](/u/neo) has indicated that live does not allow him to be fully active as CC member right now, meaning he would need to have a CC representative.

Our experiences over the last year have shown us that increasingly it has become difficult to a) get sufficient CC members to join meetings and b) get CC key-holders to sign transactions in a timely fashion. We are not yet dead in the water as CC, but we are close enough from being incapacitated for me to start this discussion to avoid us from reaching that situation. We can delay the inevitable by transferring one or two keys and installing 2-3 new representatives, or we can find a more permanent solution by _resetting the Community Council_

## The good news

The good news is that we have at least four willing and highly qualified victims … ahum.. I mean volunteers who want to join the Community Council.

[@waynegeorge](/u/waynegeorge) (software engineer, who long followed Grin)
[@bruges](/u/bruges) (aglkm) (well known from making <https://grincoin.org/>)
[@wiesche](/u/wiesche) (C/C++ developer who build a grin web wallet with the flutter framework in dart)
[@transatoshi](/u/transatoshi) (built the website <https://grinminer.net> and maintains Grin’s testnet)

If you are a community member who would like to be on the council, this would also be a great time to indicate that wish publicly.
If you are a current CC key holder or representative and you would like to stay involved or you want to step back, please indicate that wish explicitly here in your post as well as indicating how you would like the CC to proceed.
I would like to invite all old CC members/keyholders, representatives and community members (that also includes OC, you are community members) to discuss which option would be best for us to pursue:

1. Let the CC Continue as is but transfer on or two key and install 2-3 new representatives
2. Do a complete reset of the Community Council meaning we will make a new MultiSig wallet 4/6 and new CC members will be the key-holders

Note that the second option would mean a whole new set of people will be trusted with the financial future of the Community fund and it would involve setting up a new multisig and transferring all CC funds to this new wallet. This means serious work, but perhaps also a seriously refreshed and empowered Community Council .

Let us know what you think is the best for the community.

**Update, discussion thread is obsolete, new Grin Governance Council was created, see link:**

[Introducing the new Community Council (CC)](https://forum.grin.mw/t/introducing-the-new-community-council-cc/11793/14) [Governance](/c/governance/10)

Not sure it’s the right time to bring on a bunch of new people when we have nothing to do (cart before horse?).

I don’t have any ideas really, but meeting every two weeks seems a bit much. Maybe monthly makes sense. It would be nice if the meetings were in a more open place than keybase also. Apparently you can not even build the client from source anymore, so front and backend are closed source software published by Zoom Communications Inc:

I think we should really need a better management. I think I agree with [@trab](/u/trab) to keep member meetings ocassionally, not so frequently, and made them available on a social platform thats accesible for everyone and actually works for everyone.

Regarding money management I want to say that in 2023 or 2022 there was a request by [@Cobragrin](/u/cobragrin) for ~4000$ income for the position he is occupying in this project. That is not normal, and I am telling you with all my respect for your ambition for the project.

When I heard that that is the amount of money you asked and it was monthly not yearly as some of us thought, we stand against it. No one who mattered cared.

Take time and teach me what are you doing and I will do it together with you if you want, but for free. Trust me, there is no need to pay someone to bring news, when this project is in deep need of effort to be put in some other areas.

Consider: The less active the CC is, the less funding we waste.

It’s possible that my mindset on where Grin’s priorities should be better aligns with the OC rather than the CC. I’m willing to own that. I just think we should be putting everything into bare minimum functionality rather than spreading thin on side quests. I know everything is volunteer and we can’t make people do things though, so it is what it is.

I think there is a misconception here, by you and I think roughly the whole community. The old CC member want out, if possible I would also step out or reduce activity but I cannot do so without the CC becoming effectively dead. Out of the 6 of us, perhaps we can retain 3 old key-holders, but there is no willingness or ability to continue as is. Let me give a more confronting but truthful depiction of the current situation:

## Current CC key holders and representatives (4/6 MultiSig)

1. [@Paouky](/u/paouky) →  [@Mokhtar](/u/mokhtar) →  [@Cobragrin](/u/cobragrin) (representative)
_Fed up, working unpaid since start 2025_
2. [@davidtavarez](/u/davidtavarez) →  [@trab](/u/trab) (representative)
_Is the key even available for emergency signing…?, representative not joined any meetings in 6 months_
3. *[@mcm-mike](/u/mcm-mike) →  [@renzokuken](/u/renzokuken) (representative)
_Has not joined meetings in a year, key available for signing_
4. Mac/[@Neo](/u/neo)
_Cannot continue as is, does not have the time. Perhaps can stay as key-holder, but at least needs a representative_
5. [@Anynomous](/u/anynomous)
_I want to reduce Governance activity or step back completely, only key-holder_
6. [@hendi](/u/hendi) →  [@Trinitron](/u/trinitron) (representative) -
_representative not joined any meetings in past 12 months,[@hendi](/u/hendi) indicated more than year ago he does not want to be key holder_

In summary, only 4 out of 6 keys are actively available (this is the minimum for 4/6), activity wise the CC does not function at the moment and purely depends on me and [@Cobragrin](/u/cobragrin) being there.
If we want to keep as much as possible key old key-holders as suggested by [@waynegeorge](/u/waynegeorge) and supported by others, I would suggested 1) [@Anynomous](/u/anynomous) 2) [@Neo](/u/neo) 3) [@mcm-mike](/u/mcm-mike) will be key-holders of the new multisig, +3 new key holders. Regarding [@Cobragrin](/u/cobragrin), either pay him as ground keeper in which case he can also be a CC member and key holder or count him out. There is is blatant underestimation of how much time all the “little” administration things take. Personally I do not want to spend a single minute anymore on administration, but if other have the time and willingness to do it for free, go ahead.

emi22n:

> I don’t understand why the forum can’t be a meeting place, here it would have a much broader audience, which is crucially necessary.

It cannot properly handle the number of messages for a regular meeting, it is not designed for instant messaging so it is simply not the best choice. What is so hard about installing KeyBase, I just do not get why this is so often seen as a large obstacle? Perhaps we do not need every forum member to join meetings, but a few more would be nice.

Hello Grin Community,

I’d like to formally put forward my candidacy offer for Community Council membership.

I’ve been following Grin since I first heard about it back somewhere between 2017-2018. I attended the two London pre-launch meet-ups and got involved in testnet mining and a little mainnet mining on launch. I’ve been fairly quiet in the community otherwise. I do also use the account [@cryptised](/u/cryptised) here and previously on Telegram a little.

I never felt the need to get involved in governance until recently when I noticed that some of the CC were no longer participating. I’m aware of the challenges faced by the CC in recent years and don’t take the role lightly. However I believe that I can contribute and take a turn holding the torch.

I’m currently a full time software engineer and business owner in the rapidly changing AV control systems industry. I have experience working with technically minded teams who support a wide range of users in the corporate sector, mostly investment banking. Things are changing so fast though, that I’ve had to explore new opportunities to prepare for the inevitable shake up of global business as a whole. I’d love to bring some of my newly found energy and insights to the Grin project.

What do I think I can bring? My passion for crypto and technological innovation, alongside my experience in the software industry. I’d love the opportunity to support the project and become a member of its story.

## Funding proposal: Grin integration into Unstoppable Wallet
*Date: 2025-05-12 | [Forum Link](https://forum.grin.mw/t/funding-proposal-grin-integration-into-unstoppable-wallet/11765)*
*Importance Score: 99.9 | Core Participants: tromp*

### Post by @ddadybayo (2025-05-12)
*Post #1*

Hello Grin community,

My name is Dan, and I represent the [Unstoppable Wallet](https://unstoppable.money) team — a leading open-source, mobile-first wallet focused on privacy, security, and decentralization.

**Website:** [unstoppable.money](https://unstoppable.money)
**GitHub:** [github.com/horizontalsystems](https://github.com/horizontalsystems)
**Twitter:** [@unstoppablebyhs](https://twitter.com/unstoppablebyhs)

Since 2018, we’ve been building Unstoppable as a multi-asset, non-custodial wallet with reproducible builds and a growing user base worldwide. The wallet is recommended by [Bitcoin.org](http://Bitcoin.org) and supports 20+ blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Zcash.

We are now exploring the integration of **Grin** into Unstoppable Wallet and would like to initiate this discussion with the community and Grin CC to define a viable path forward, including possible funding.

### Why Grin?

At Unstoppable, we share Grin’s core values: **privacy** , **decentralization** , and **censorship resistance**. We’ve seen increasing demand from our community for a privacy-preserving cryptocurrency like Grin, and we believe that supporting Grin will provide users with a secure, convenient, and mobile-native option for managing their coins.

Adding Grin to Unstoppable means:

* Access to Grin on **iOS** , **Android** , and **F-Droid**
* Native **send/receive functionality** using modern Slatepack protocols
* An **open-source implementation** maintained by an active team
* Improved UX and availability for privacy-conscious users

### Why It Matters for the Grin Ecosystem

Grin currently lacks strong representation in the mobile wallet space. Most existing Grin wallets are desktop-based or CLI-driven, which limits accessibility for a wider audience.

Integration into Unstoppable would:

* Expand **Grin’s reach** to mobile-first users across platforms
* Enable **multi-asset management** alongside other privacy coins like Monero and Zcash
* Strengthen **decentralization** by reducing dependency on niche or centralized tooling
* Provide **open-source, reproducible builds** and long-term maintenance

We’ve successfully implemented other complex privacy integrations, and understand the technical nuances and security implications of working with Mimblewimble-based protocols.

### What We’re Asking

We are seeking **community funding** to allocate the necessary resources for development, QA, and maintenance of Grin integration. Funding details can be discussed collaboratively based on feedback and deliverables.

Specifically, we’d like your input on:

* What features are a _must-have_ for initial release?
* Are there preferred sync strategies (e.g., node vs. light clients)?
* What kind of funding range would be considered realistic for this scope?

### Our Commitment

* The work will be **fully open-source** under the MIT license
* We will **communicate openly** and share progress regularly
* Milestones and deliverables will be **clearly defined and tracked**
* We will explore long-term support and future improvements.

* * *

We’re excited about the opportunity to contribute to Grin and would be glad to answer questions, refine the scope, and move this forward together with the community.

Thank you for your time and consideration!

I have a few questions.

1. From the coins supported/listed by Unstopable wallet, how many paid for being integrated? Which ones paid, which ones did not and why? I think Monero did not pay right, although there was a proposal?

2. How much funds are you seeking, how many hours work do you expect and why?

Although support for grin would be nice, I do not see a way swaps can be supported technically. Also I wonder if adding grin to such a specific privacy oriented wallet might actually negatively impact grins reputation🤔. Yes Grin is privacy preserving, but it is not the main purpose. Could adding grin to Unstopable wallet squarely put us in the bucket of privacy coins that many regulators are cracking down on?

Do you support MWEB transactions on Litecoin?
And if so, much did Litecoin pay for the work of supporting that?

For which blockchains do you support the running of nodes? Do those nodes sync from scratch?

I got the same icky feeling about it ending up drawing negative attention towards Grin. Nothing about their approach or how they represent themselves leave me with any confidence it’s not just a list em then dump after we get their Bitcoin scam.

Plus the dude was even pushing it in the comments of the next GrinCC meeting’s agenda on Github. Like school in the summer, no class.

Thanks for the thoughtful questions - let me try to address them clearly:

**1\. On funding and past integrations:**
We’ve been building Unstoppable Wallet independently for the past 8 years, entirely self-funded. Unlike other wallets that raise capital, we’ve chosen to stay lean and self-reliant - which also means we can’t integrate every chain that comes our way unless there’s clear demand or support.

All the blockchains currently supported in the wallet were added without external funding. That includes Monero - we didn’t receive any funding from their community. That said, due to user demand, we’re actively working on Monero integration regardless.

More recently, we’ve started receiving inbound interest from various communities (including Grin) asking about support - which is why we’re opening up the conversation. A grant from the Grin community would help us prioritize the work and allocate proper resources.

**2\. On the Grin proposal itself:**
This proposal is meant as a starting point to gauge community interest and see if Grin users feel a mobile wallet like Unstoppable would add value - especially with a smoother experience for managing and storing assets.

From our side, we estimate the integration would take roughly **7–9 weeks** , including support for custom nodes. Based on prior experience with similar efforts, we believe a **$60K** budget would cover the full scope - development, QA, and maintenance.

Happy to dig deeper into any of this or adjust the proposal based on your feedback.

Thanks for raising these points – they’re totally valid and worth addressing.

Our intent with this proposal isn’t to “get paid to list Grin” or treat it as just another project for exposure. We submitted this proposal to understand whether there’s interest from the Grin community in having a well-maintained, open-source mobile wallet with strong UX and long-term support.

If funding isn’t available – that’s perfectly understandable. What we’re hoping for is a conversation about whether there’s a meaningful way to collaborate. For example, could Unstoppable become the default or recommended wallet for the Grin ecosystem? Could we work together on outreach, visibility, or ecosystem improvements? These kinds of relationships help us prioritize integrations and justify the time and resources needed.

If the general consensus is that the community isn’t interested in a mobile wallet like ours or wouldn’t support it even post-integration – that’s fair too, and we’ll focus elsewhere.

For context: we’ve developed Unstoppable Wallet independently for over 8 years, with no VC backing. Every integration we’ve done has been driven by real user demand – not pay-to-play deals. Grin would be no different.

We’re here for a constructive conversation. If there’s a better way to work together beyond a grant – let’s discuss it. We’re open to ideas and committed to building for the long term.

Ok, so here are my quick thoughts regarding Grin integration in Unstoppable wallet.

1. Integration of Grin in Unstoppable wallet would provide a “first” for both Unstoppable wallet and for Grin. Unstoppable wallet would be the first/only multi coin wallet that supports Grin, which does provides a reputation boost and a unique selling point to the wallet. For Grin, it would open the world of MultiCoin wallet support.

2. No other project paid for integrating their coin in Unstoppable wallet, why should grin be an exception?
I do find this valid reason not to pay, however…grin is different from other projects. Grin is interactive, even the key derivation is not exactly confirm BIP32, BIP44 or any other standard (unfortunately). Hence it will involve more work to integrated and perhaps a bounty, more modest than 60k, e.g. 30k? should be open to discussion IMO. If significant functionalities would be added, more funding could be made available.

3. At the moment integration of Grin in Unstoppable wallet will not yet unlock its true potential since there is no easy way to swap it. This would be a reason to wait with integration both from the perspective of the Unstoppable wallet team as well as for Grin as project.

4. If a bounty would be made, we need to be clear about the long term alignment of the objectives of Grin as project and of this wallet as well as long term commitment to support Grin. We do want integration to be temporary nor do we want this to lead to negative attraction of regulator attention. Grin should not be considered privacy maximalist money, even though in the future potential some users might want to use it as such (adding mwixnet, still only as much privacy as Monero at this point).

5. The Grin Community Council does have funding and this funding is less rapidly depleted than the increase of its value. Hence we should be sensible but not extremely conservative in funding. If we can find proper reason to support a bounty for Grin integration in a wallet, we should at least explore the possibilities.
If some unique added value would be created for the project e.g. developing atomic swap , adding MultiSig support, this would warrant significant funding. Perhaps some long term objectives that both benefit this specific wallet integration as well as long term benefits to the project can be achieved.

I agree that the discussion should focus on the concrete value of the contribution and the kind of impact it can have for the Grin ecosystem.

Let me outline how we at Unstoppable view the scope of the integration and how it aligns with your suggestions:

**a) Native mobile libraries**
Our proposal goes beyond just “adding Grin” - we’re offering to build native libraries for both iOS and Android from scratch. At the moment, no such mobile-native libraries exist for Grin.
One of the key advantages of Unstoppable Wallet is our **fully native architecture** , which enables much better performance, security, and responsiveness compared to cross-platform frameworks like Flutter or React Native a common choice among other wallets.

**b) DEX functionality**
We would love to integrate a DEX for Grin if there was one available and actively maintained. Currently, Unstoppable supports several DEX integrations for EVM chains such as Uniswap, 1inch, PancakeSwap — and we’re adding **Thorchain** in the upcoming sprint.
Unfortunately, the Grin ecosystem doesn’t yet have a working DEX, which means this feature isn’t currently feasible. We’re more than happy to integrate one in the future if the community develops such a solution.

**c) BIP39 + Passphrase**
We’ve supported **BIP39 with passphrase** since version 0.21 ([Release notes here](https://unstoppablewallet.medium.com/whats-new-version-0-21-c247a09d8b05)).
If Grin eventually adopts a standard derivation path and clearly documents the format, we will be glad to support it as well. We’re strong advocates for flexibility and enhanced user security.

**d) Node setup**
Our current plan is to integrate Grin with a **light node** approach, but we’re also open to enabling users to connect to **custom full nodes** in the future. It’s something we can evaluate further depending on user needs and technical feasibility.

**Additional privacy-focused features**
Unstoppable Wallet already includes a variety of privacy-enhancing features that align well with the ethos of Grin. These include:

* **Duress Mode** , which allows users to hide sensitive assets or accounts under stress.
* **Built-in TOR VPN** on Android and F-Droid versions, giving users more anonymity and control when managing their assets.

## My Struggle With Grin

Why, they ask—why does such a pure, beautiful project like Grin limp forward like a ghost ship drifting through dead waters? Why no adoption? Why no devs? Why no listings, no buzz, no believers?

Let me tell you why.

Price.

In this backwards world, truth doesn’t spread because it’s true. It spreads because it’s rich. People follow green candles, not gray papers. You want adoption? You want development? You want a vibrant community, new exchanges, listings, tools, mobile wallets, hype, memes, traction, life?

Raise. The. Damn. Price.

That’s it. That’s the whole secret.

Because people don’t actually think for themselves—they follow signals. And the loudest signal in crypto is price. As price goes up, suddenly Grin’s simplicity is elegant. Suddenly Mimblewimble is revolutionary. Suddenly no-premine is noble. Suddenly devs return. Suddenly eyes open.

And listen—until now, the price was doomed. Grin’s early inflation was brutal, unrelenting. Every block another nail in its own coffin. The market couldn’t breathe under that weight. But now? Now the tide is turning. Inflation is flattening. Issuance is predictable, stable, sane. The charts don’t lie—the bleeding is slowing.

Now is the time.

If we push now—if we put pressure, set the tone, build a floor, force the narrative—price will move. And when it does, so will everything else. People will follow. Devs will wake up. Gatekeepers will say “wait, what’s this Grin thing again?” The signal will be undeniable.

The technology is already here. The ethos is already here. The potential is rotting on the table because we’ve let price rot. And that ends now.

Because if Grin’s price rises, Grin rises.

And if Grin rises?

So do we.

[@Anynomous](/u/anynomous) It takes a village bro. It is not my responsibility to raise the price - if only there was some sorta community fund that could be deployed to achieve this. Oh wait, there is! hahaha

You’d figure it would be logical to spend the grin fund on I dunno, grin? Lol

Why is that ironic? Grin doesn’t hold its value long term right now because of the inflation. If the CC held its funds in Grin it would be basically zero now lol. Do you think the people that created Grin were stupid?

Am I the only one who does not mind a low price and uses the opportunity to load up. If the price goes high, I am happy since I can shop using Grin, if the price goes low, I am happy because I can load up. Price never ever has been or will be anyone’s responsibility. The market determines the price.

I wonder has anyone ever complained to the Bitcoin core team why they were not using their funds to pump the price

All you gotta say is “how much higher would grins price be if the cc had grin instead of btc?”

Then that is how much they have taken away from grin.

The mental gymnastics demonstrated by the cc here to refute this very obvious truth is quite impressive.

If someone donates grin to the cc they sell it for btc. Driving down the price of Grin! Forshame!

So the cc can say it’s not their responsibly to drive grin’s price up but they sure as hell have taken it as their responsibility to drive it down! Turning every grin donation into another opportunity to dump on grin’s price.

Here’s an idea I know it might sound crazy but maybe the cc should hold the crypto they supposedly are a group of, rather than a currency of a completely unrelated project. Its seems like they are using grin to harvest as much btc as they can get their little grubby fingers on at the expensive of grin’s value!

Like a said, it’s scammy.

You can call yourselves the “grin cc” but remember this: Money is power and Grin is money so if you don’t hold grin you have no power here!!!

Created this thread to post updates, should any be required. It is unfortunate that TO has become so important to Grin that it’s demise would be a painful blow. This should come as a reminder that this coin needs more places to buy and trade.

Just to be clear on the linguistics used here.

“There are many phishing sites” is different from “These are phishing sites”

That aside, providing the actual links to the phishing sites is suss, and any decent Discord admin will tell you that.

Suss is the fact that me pointing out precisely this, with imediately being flagged is suss. 3 messages talking about phishing sites, posting links etc and then getting a comment banned for mentioning that this should not be a supported practice, is suss.

## Request for funding Cuckatoo reference miner
*Date: 2025-08-20 | [Forum Link](https://forum.grin.mw/t/request-for-funding-cuckatoo-reference-miner/12033)*
*Importance Score: 116.9 | Core Participants: yeastplume, tromp*

### Post by @Thomas (2025-08-20)
*Post #1*

rewrite this on Rust:

[GitHub - NicolasFlamel1/Cuckatoo-Reference-Miner: Cuckatoo miner that supports cuckatoo10 to cuckatoo32 and implements mean, slean, and lean edge trimming on the GPU using OpenCL and Metal.](https://github.com/NicolasFlamel1/Cuckatoo-Reference-Miner) .

Here is the dev plan.

# Cuckatoo → Rust: Progressive Milestones (easy ➜ hard)

## Milestone 1 — Workspace & CPU “lean” baseline

**Objective:** Stand up a Rust workspace + a correct CPU reference for **lean** trimming and cycle verification for small EDGE_BITS (e.g., 12–16).
**Why first:** Gives you a truth model to compare GPU and other modes against.

**Scope**

· Create cargo workspace:

o `cuckatoo-core` (algorithms & data types)

o `cuckatoo-miner` (CLI runner; no networking yet)

· Implement:

o Header→edge generation (SipHash-2-4).

o **Lean** edge bitmap & node degree bitmap; one trim round; full 42-round trim loop.

o Cycle verifier (42-cycle check).

· CLI (parity with README wording where sensible):
`--edge-bits`, `--mode lean`, `--tuning` (offline), print **Searching time** vs **Trimming time** like the C++ tool.

**Deliverables**

· Passing unit tests on hashing, 1-round trimming behavior, and cycle verification on toy graphs.

· `cargo run -- --tuning --edge-bits 12 --mode lean` executes and prints timings.

**Acceptance**

· For fixed seeds at EDGE_BITS ≤ 16: CPU-lean produces stable survivors and can locate at least one valid 42-cycle on toy inputs.

**Risks/Mitigation**

· Tiny graphs may rarely contain a 42-cycle → include synthetic fixtures for the cycle checker.

* * *

## Milestone 2 — CPU “mean” buckets + tuned memory

**Objective:** CPU **mean** trimmer with bucketed edges (locality speedup) and knobs mirroring the C++ miner.
**Scope**

· Implement **mean** trimmer (bucket sorting; contiguous access).

· Expose build/CLI knobs used by the C++ miner’s tuning section:

o `TRIMMING_ROUNDS`, `LOCAL_RAM_KILOBYTES` (use as logical sizing hint), `SLEAN_TRIMMING_PARTS` placeholder.

· CPU micro-benchmarks (Criterion) for lean vs mean at small EDGE_BITS.

**Acceptance**

· Mean trimmer ≥2× faster than lean on CPU for EDGE_BITS 16–20 in benchmarks.

· CLI prints timings in the same “Searching/Trimming” vocabulary.

* * *

## Milestone 3 — CPU “slean” (semi-lean) multi-pass

**Objective:** Implement **slean** (K parts) to simulate lower VRAM needs.
**Scope**

· Add K-pass slean with `SLEAN_TRIMMING_PARTS` (power-of-two) and validate trade-offs: lower memory vs more rounds.

· Golden tests: survivors after slean(K=1) == mean; increasing K maintains correctness.

**Acceptance**

· slean results match mean for test vectors; performance/memory trade-off charted in docs.

* * *

## Milestone 4 — CLI parity & multi-instance ergonomics

**Objective:** Mirror the C++ **usage shape** so users won’t be surprised.
**Scope**

· Flags matching README behavior/semantics:

o `--display_gpus` (stub prints “CPU only” for now)

o `--mean_trimming/--slean_trimming/--lean_trimming` allow-list

o `--total_number_of_instances`, `--instance` (CPU core partitioning)

· Config file (TOML) + env overrides.

**Acceptance**

· Running multiple processes with `--total_number_of_instances/--instance` shows non-overlapping CPU core affinity (documented benefit).

* * *

## Milestone 5 — Stratum V1 minimal client

**Objective:** Talk to pools; mine with CPU.
**Scope**

· Async Stratum client (Tokio + Serde JSON): subscribe/authorize/notify/submit.

· CLI matches README’s pool style: `-a host:port -u user[.rig]` and the verbose long flags (`--stratum_server_*`). Pools cited in README: 2Miners, WoolyPooly, MWC Pool, Pacific Pool.

· Job switch + cancellation (short nonce batches).

**Acceptance**

· Connects to a test pool (or mock), receives jobs, submits valid shares for small EDGE_BITS.

**Notes**

· 2Miners/WoolyPooly endpoints & account format come from README & pool pages. [GitHub](https://github.com/NicolasFlamel1/Cuckatoo-Reference-Miner)[2Miners](https://2miners.com/mwc-mining-pool?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[WoolyPooly](https://woolypooly.com/en/coin/mwc?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* * *

## Milestone 6 — GPU host harness (wgpu) + SPIR-V loader

**Objective:** Cross-platform GPU **host** setup once, then reuse everywhere.
**Scope**

· Add `cuckatoo-gpu` crate:

o Initialize **wgpu** (Vulkan/DX12/Metal backends).

o Enumerate adapters for `--display_gpus`, implement `--gpu N`.

· Set up Rust-GPU toolchain to compile a tiny shader crate to SPIR-V (no-op compute) with `spirv-builder`; load with wgpu and dispatch. [embarkstudios.github.io](https://embarkstudios.github.io/rust-gpu/book/building-rust-gpu.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Acceptance**

· `--display_gpus` lists actual GPUs; a dummy compute pass runs on selected device.

**Why wgpu**

· One codepath maps to Vulkan/D3D12/Metal automatically; future-proof vs deprecated bindings. (metal-rs is deprecated; use `objc2-metal` if we need native Metal later.)

* * *

## Milestone 7 — GPU “mean” trimming round (Rust-GPU kernel)

**Objective:** Port **one** trimming round of **mean** to a Rust shader; validate against CPU.
**Scope**

· Write `#[spirv(compute)]` kernel that:

o Reads edge segments/buckets,

o Computes per-node degree (shared memory where possible),

o Marks edges for deletion.

· Host side: per-round dispatch loop; compact survivors (prefix-sum pass or mark-and-sweep buffer).

· Correctness harness: small/mid EDGE_BITS compare GPU vs CPU survivors bit-for-bit.

**Acceptance**

· GPU mean one round == CPU mean one round (bytes equal); multi-round pipeline produces same survivors list for EDGE_BITS up to 20.

* * *

## Milestone 8 — Full GPU “mean” pipeline + perf targets

**Objective:** Chain 42 rounds on GPU; bring back survivors for CPU cycle finding.
**Scope**

· Device-local buffers for edges/bitmaps; staging buffers for download.

· Batch size & workgroup size tuning; expose specialization constants or shader feature flags for power users (documented).

· Performance target: ≥5× CPU-mean speedup for EDGE_BITS ~20–24 on a mid-tier GPU.

**Acceptance**

· End-to-end (job→GPU trimming→CPU cycle→submit) runs faster than CPU-only; stable over hours.

* * *

## Milestone 9 — GPU “slean” (K-parts) & auto-fallback

**Objective:** Add **slean** on GPU + automatic mode choosing like the C++ miner’s “try mean→slean→lean” behavior.
**Scope**

· Implement K-segment GPU pipeline (partitions processed sequentially to fit VRAM).

· At startup, probe adapter memory; choose mean→slean→lean in that order unless user restricts via flags (`--mean_trimming/--slean_trimming/--lean_trimming`).

**Acceptance**

· On lower-VRAM GPUs, slean runs successfully with the same correctness as CPU; auto-fallback picks the fastest feasible mode and logs the choice.

* * *

## Milestone 10 — Plan-B backends (OpenCL & native Metal) for parity

**Objective:** If rust-gpu hits a wall, provide **OpenCL** (Linux/Windows/Android) and **Metal** (macOS/iOS) backends mirroring the repo’s kernels.
**Scope**

· OpenCL host (`ocl`/`opencl3`) loading **lean_trimming.cl / mean_trimming.cl / slean_trimming.cl** from the repo.

· Native Metal host using **objc2-metal** to compile **lean/mean/slean .metal** sources.

· Common trait `GpuTrimmer` so wgpu/rust-gpu vs OpenCL/Metal are swappable.

**Acceptance**

· Either path (Unified SPIR-V OR OC L/Metal) passes the same correctness suite and meets performance targets.

* * *

## Milestone 11 — Runtime parity flags & GPU RAM control

**Objective:** Match **user options** from README precisely for a polished UX.
**Scope**

· Implement:

o `--gpu_ram <GB>` (where supported by platform), `--gpu N`, `--display_gpus` richer info,

o Multi-process guidance: `--total_number_of_instances`, `--instance` behavior to avoid CPU contention,

o Explicit trimming allow-lists, build-time TUNING=1 mode (skip Stratum).

**Acceptance**

· Commands analogous to README examples behave as documented (including tuning mode & pool commands).

* * *

## Milestone 12 — Cross-platform packaging (Win/macOS/Linux)

**Objective:** Ship binaries that “just run”.
**Scope**

· Windows MSVC build; Vulkan/D3D12 backend selection verified.

· macOS (Intel/Apple Silicon) universal build; Metal path tested.

· Linux (x86_64) packages; validate with proprietary & Mesa drivers.

**Acceptance**

· Three OSes can mine on common GPUs; `--display_gpus` shows proper adapters; no driver-specific crashes.

* * *

## Milestone 13 — Mobile proofs (iOS/Android)

**Objective:** Demonstrate feasibility, not sustained mobile mining.
**Scope**

· iOS test app linking Rust lib; runs tiny EDGE_BITS with Metal.

· Android NDK build via `cargo-ndk`; simple CLI or JNI app.

· Respect README iOS/Android build patterns (Xcode/NDK invocations).

**Acceptance**

· Tiny tuning jobs complete on device; Stratum socket works; resource usage is controlled.

* * *

## Milestone 14 — Performance Autotuner & long-haul stability

**Objective:** Hit production-worthy throughput and stability.
**Scope**

· Autotuner: balance **Searching time** vs **Trimming time** by adjusting `TRIMMING_ROUNDS`, workgroup sizes, and batch sizes (aim: Searching ≤ Trimming, but close).

· 24–72h soak tests against two different pools (e.g., 2Miners + mwcpool) with telemetry (accepted/rejected shares, graphs/sec).

**Acceptance**

· Stable over multi-day runs, >95% share acceptance, no memory growth.

* * *

## Milestone 15 — Docs, examples, and release

**Objective:** Make it easy to use and extend.
**Scope**

· Comprehensive README with:

o Build matrix, GPU support table, typical **VRAM** per EDGE_BITS & mode, pool command examples (as in original README).

· Troubleshooting guide (driver quirks, OpenCL fallback notes, Metal/iOS caveats).

· Versioned releases (tag + artifacts).

**Acceptance**

I don’t see the point in limiting EDGE_BITS. You might as well allow the full range of 4–63.

Thomas:

> full 42-round trim loop.

There’s nothing “full” about 42 rounds. In fact, number of trimming rounds has little to do with cycle length.

Thomas:

Thomas:

No need to hardcode 42. Better make it a runtime configurable CYCLE_LENGTH. You test tiny graphs with tiny cycle lengths.

Thomas:

> Mean trimmer ≥2× faster

The C implementation showed a ~ 4x speed improvement, so this seems rather modest.

Yes, they are, except that the docs price seems comparatively low, and that is already grouped in with release.

The value of the project depends not only on meeting the objective milestones, but on the code and documentation quality as well.

These can be copied from the existing grin code [1] [2]

You still mention 42-round after I pointed out above that number of rounds has little to do with cycle length.

Thomas:

The number of expected solutions is not 0. It’s approximately 1/L where L is the cycle length.

If you bothered to search 1000 random graphs with say, --edge-bits 19, then you should find over a dozen of them.

Thomas:

The only reason you pass the test is because your verifier is bogus,

claiming that a non-42-cycle is a 42-cycle.

Thomas:

Then demonstrate it by showing a run with --edge-bits 19 that finds a 42-cycle.

Thomas:

That proves it no more than it proves my 3 lines of code above to function correctly.

Thomas:

No, it only requires a correct implementation of lean mining, as I have done in [cuckoo/src/cuckatoo at master · tromp/cuckoo · GitHub](https://github.com/tromp/cuckoo/tree/master/src/cuckatoo/)

Milestone 1 was for a correctly working lean mining implementation, which you have failed to demonstrate.

### Memory Considerations

**Important** : Higher edge-bits require significant memory:

* `edge-bits 4-16`: Safe, low memory usage

* `edge-bits 17-20`: Moderate memory usage

* `edge-bits 21+`: High memory usage, may crash on systems with <32GB RAM

The above text betrays a lack of understanding of lean mining.

Lean mining a CuckatooN graph should require only 2^{N+1} bits of memory for trimming.

E.g. my lean miner reports:

Looking for 42-cycle on cuckatoo19(“”) with trimming to 11 bits, 96 trimming rounds, 1 threads
Using 64KB edge and 64KB node memory, and 1-way siphash

Edge bits 21 should take well under 1MB of memory, which is a rather small amount easily fitting in a CPU’s cache. More than 16GB should only be needed for cuckatoo36.

Can you please report back when you have a demonstrable lean mining ability to find 42-cycles in a 19 edge-bits cuckatoo graph?

You are not following the specification [1] for generating Cuckatoo graphs.

In particular, you’re using 128 bit siphash keys instead of the 256 bit ones specified on line 2.

Worse yet is your deviation from line 7:

for 0 <= i < N, E_i = (V_i_0, V_i_1) = (siphash24(K,2*i) % N, siphash24(K,2*i+1) % N)

where instead you use

for 0 <= i < N, E_i = (V_i_0, V_i_1) = (siphash24(K,i) % N, siphash24(K,i+1) % N)

Finally, the worst part is that your notion of cycle is completely wrong.

Found 42-cycle in 0.005568s
Cycle length: 42
SipHash keys: [0x736f6d6570736575, 0x646f72616e646f6d]
Cycle edge indices:
Edge 0: 454 -> 930 (index: 1669)
Edge 1: 930 -> 238 (index: 892)

Edges 0 and 1 are not incident, since node 930 in partition V is a completely different node from node 930 in partition U. Furthermore, the endpoints of incident edges should differ in only their last bit.
