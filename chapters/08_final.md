# Chapter 8: Governance Evolution

As the scheduled hard forks concluded, Grin's governance was transforming. The informal "technomity" that had guided the project through launch and early development was giving way to something more distributed. Key contributors were stepping back. New voices were emerging. The project was becoming what it had always claimed to be: a truly community-driven endeavor.

## The Core Team Transition

The departure had been gradual rather than sudden. Igno Peverell, Grin's founding developer, had faded from the project in 2019—his last forum posts appearing that August. There had been no dramatic announcement, no explanation. One day he was there; over time, he wasn't.

Lehnberg acknowledged the loss openly: "We never expected to find ourselves a few months after mainnet having launched without Igno. Core team members were all looking to Igno for leadership, and he disappeared way too early. We're definitely not perfect, and none of us are close to having the leadership qualities that Igno had."

The remaining core team—Yeastplume, Lehnberg, jaspervdm, antioch, and others—had to fill the gap. There was no playbook for this. Grin had been designed to survive the loss of any individual contributor, but theory was different from practice.

## Research and Funding

One sign of maturation was the emergence of funded research proposals. In April 2020, a researcher using the pseudonym DrazenV submitted a request for €5,000 to investigate BLS signatures—specifically whether they could enable kernel aggregation in Grin.

The proposal sparked debate about standards and transparency. How should the community evaluate anonymous researchers? What credentials were required? How much should specialized work cost?

"My formal education is at the level of a PhD, which is in mathematics and specifically the mathematics of public key cryptography," DrazenV wrote. Some community members questioned the phrasing. Others questioned whether a month of research was worth €5,000.

Antioch offered a constructive path forward, suggesting the work be split into prerequisites and subsequent research: "Maybe one way to approach this would be a 'literature review' to summarize where we stand today... This would give us a solid baseline and starting point for evaluating further possible research."

The discussion illustrated both the promise and challenge of decentralized research funding. Without a foundation or academic institution to vet proposals, the community had to develop its own standards.

## The Yeastunit

Developer compensation had coalesced around what the community informally called a "yeastunit"—€10,000 per month, the rate established by Yeastplume's original funding campaigns. It became the standard against which other proposals were measured.

Antioch's funding requests showed how the process worked in practice. Each quarter, developers would submit proposals detailing their planned work, past contributions, and funding needs. The community would discuss, question, and ultimately decide whether to approve.

"I would like to request a further 3 months of funding to cover July through to September," Antioch wrote in one such request. "This would be for the standard yeastunit of €10k/month."

The transparency was notable. Every proposal was public. Every discussion was recorded. Anyone could participate—and anyone could object.

## New Directions

As the scheduled forks concluded, developers' attention shifted toward features that could improve Grin's usability without requiring consensus changes. Antioch outlined several possibilities:

"Mostly lock-free transactions"—reducing the time users needed to wait for transactions to complete. PayJoin—a technique for improving privacy by having recipients contribute inputs to transactions. Multi-party outputs for atomic swaps. Payment channels leveraging the newly-enabled relative kernel locks.

"These all share some commonality," Antioch observed, "specifically around the interactive transaction building process, fine-grained control over output selection and kernel offset adjustments."

The work would be challenging—it required changes to how wallets built transactions without breaking compatibility or introducing security vulnerabilities. But it represented the kind of incremental improvement that could make Grin more practical for everyday use.

## Community Council

The governance structure continued to evolve. The original "technomity"—the technocratic council of core contributors—began transitioning toward a broader community council model. The change reflected both philosophical commitment and practical necessity: as original contributors stepped back, new participants needed paths to involvement.

The shift wasn't always smooth. Debates arose about decision-making processes, fund allocation, and the balance between technical purity and practical adoption. But the debates themselves were evidence of a healthy community—people cared enough to argue.

## The RFC Process

Technical decisions increasingly flowed through a formal RFC (Request for Comments) process. Proposals were submitted as pull requests, discussed publicly, and merged only after community review.

The process brought discipline to decision-making. Ideas that might once have been implemented on a developer's whim now required written justification, community feedback, and explicit approval. It slowed things down but improved quality and buy-in.

RFCs covered everything from spending guidelines for the general fund to technical standards for transaction building. They became the project's institutional memory—a record of not just what was decided but why.

## Looking Forward

By the end of 2021, Grin's governance had matured significantly from its early days. The informal coordination among a small group of developers had given way to documented processes, community councils, and formal funding mechanisms.

The transition wasn't complete—governance never is. But the foundation was solid. Grin had demonstrated that a cryptocurrency project could evolve its social structures as deliberately as its technical ones.

The question facing the community was no longer whether it could survive without its founders. It was what it would build now that it had proven it could.
