# Chapter 6: First Hard Fork

On July 17, 2019, at block height 262,080, Grin executed its first scheduled hard fork. The upgrade had been planned since before mainnet launch—part of the project's commitment to iterating on the protocol during its early years. What happened on that day would set the tone for the network upgrades to follow.

## The v2.0.0 Release

Two weeks before the fork, Yeastplume announced the release of Grin v2.0.0 and grin-wallet v2.0.0. The changes were substantial but focused:

"Changes in these releases have been almost entirely focused on hard fork support and ensuring the entire ecosystem will be running the same version of the transaction-exchange format (the Slate) post-upgrade."

The node included support for Blockheader version 2, a tweaked secondary proof-of-work algorithm called "Cuckarood," and a new Bulletproof rewind scheme. The wallet dropped support for older slate versions and API versions—a clean break that would simplify maintenance going forward.

The compatibility table told the story: pre-2.0.0 nodes and wallets would simply stop working after block 262,080. Everyone needed to upgrade.

"Please be advised that a breaking upgrade will happen at block height 262,080 and pre-2.0.0 wallets and nodes will stop working at this point," the announcement warned. "All users will need to upgrade to version 2.0.0 in order to be able to continue using Grin."

## A Smooth Transition

The hard fork itself was anticlimactic—which was exactly the point. Nodes upgraded. Miners switched to the new algorithms. The network continued producing blocks.

Mining pools had a rougher transition. Some took days to update their payout systems to work with the new wallet format. "3-4 days of mining there with unpaid status," reported one miner about their pool experience. Hard forks are never easy, even when they're scheduled.

But the core protocol transition worked. The months of preparation, the careful versioning, the compatibility matrices—all of it paid off. Grin had demonstrated that it could upgrade itself without drama.

## Community Conversations

With the hard fork behind them, community members turned to bigger questions. A forum thread titled "Opinions regarding Grin" captured the mood six months after launch.

The thread began with praise: "Developers must be commended for their hardwork and effort during the past 4 years. It's almost completely unheard for a team to undertake a massive project such as this... with no reliance on corporations and institutions."

But concerns followed. Where was the security audit report? What exactly was the relationship between the dual proof-of-work algorithms and ASIC manufacturers? How would Grin compete with the forks and clones that were emerging?

Jasper van der Maarel, who had become increasingly central to the project, responded with characteristic directness: "Grin *is* the community. Or at least that is what it aims for. So if you think the project needs to do certain things or needs to start certain discussions, you are more than welcome to start on them."

## The Adoption Question

A dedicated thread on increasing Grin adoption drew passionate responses. One community member articulated what many felt:

"I have been following Grin now for a few months. It has astonished me how it towers above other cryptocurrencies. It is by far the new paradigm for privacy coins. The only videos and articles I have read have been pitched at an enthusiast crowd. I have wondered why this coin does not have a marketing team."

The suggestions were practical: an official GUI wallet (or at least one vetted by the council), Ledger hardware wallet support, more exchange listings, better liquidity.

The core team's response was consistent with their philosophy: they would build the tools, but community members needed to drive adoption efforts themselves. "If you think 'trying to get the masses to mine grin' is a worthwhile cause, feel free to devote your time to it," wrote jaspervdm.

This wasn't dismissiveness—it was a genuine belief that sustainable growth came from distributed effort rather than centralized marketing. Whether that belief was correct remained to be seen.

## Security Audit Progress

The security audit that had been commissioned with community funds was nearing completion. Joltz, who had taken point on security matters, provided transparency about the process:

"Regarding the last audit, my understanding is that the core team has had it for about two months. This still gives us an opportunity to publish around the 90 day mark."

He outlined the process: the team would review issues and fixes, auditors would verify the remediations, and then the public reports would be released jointly. It was methodical, responsible work that didn't make for exciting announcements but was essential for the project's credibility.

"I think it's pretty neat that a donation-based decentralized project was able to receive an audit of this quality, address the findings and ultimately share it with the community in a (somewhat) reasonable timeline," Joltz observed.

## Another Coinbase Donation

On November 11, 2019, Lehnberg announced the receipt of another anonymous coinbase donation to Grin's General Fund—a second gift of early-mined Bitcoin, echoing the May donation that had electrified the community months earlier.

Lehnberg shared excerpts from a brief exchange with the donor, who wished to remain anonymous: "I know how you treated the last donation, this is why I am contacting you." The donor's message struck a tone that resonated deeply with the community's values: "It feels like 2009/2010 again... It's wonderful that we have GRIN now, our motives are not economical! It's about the technology and the protocol."

The donor addressed the development team directly: "We saw your work and your ethics towards the project and your interest free work. This is what we are honouring right now with these donations so that you can work freely on GRIN. Without economic dependencies."

The message concluded: "Hopefully we judged it right, time will tell."

The back-to-back coinbase donations—both from early Bitcoin miners who had chosen to support Grin with coins worth hundreds of thousands of dollars—sent a signal that went beyond funding. Someone who had been present at the dawn of Bitcoin saw something in Grin worth backing.

## Looking Ahead

The first hard fork marked a transition point. The frantic energy of launch had settled into the steadier rhythm of ongoing development. The next hard fork was scheduled for January 2020—six months away. Then another in July 2020, and a final one in January 2021.

After that, the scheduled forks would end. The protocol would stabilize. The secondary proof-of-work would phase out entirely, leaving only the ASIC-friendly Cuckatoo algorithm. Grin would become what it was always meant to be: a stable, privacy-preserving currency that could run for decades without requiring users to constantly upgrade.

But that was still eighteen months away. For now, there was work to do: wallets to improve, features to add, a community to nurture. The first hard fork had proven that Grin could evolve. The question was what it would evolve into.
