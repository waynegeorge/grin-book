# Chapter 10: Legacy & Future

In June 2019, the Grin community received news that everyone had been dreading but no one wanted to acknowledge. Igno Peverell, the project's founder, was stepping away.

## The Announcement

Yeastplume delivered the message on behalf of the council:

"As some have already noticed, Igno has not been very active over the past few weeks. He recently communicated to us in the council that he needs to be away from the project for a while for personal reasons. We do not have further details on his situation or a timeline for his return, but we anticipate he will be absent for at least a few months, possibly more."

The announcement was deliberately understated. No drama. No speculation about reasons. Just acknowledgment of the facts and a statement of continuity: "As Grin is open source and not reliant on any single person or group in order to progress, our work continues uninterrupted in his absence."

Yeastplume included a message from Igno himself: Grin was "in the best hands possible." This was directed not just to the council but to the community as a whole.

## Speculation and Reality

The community reacted with a mix of concern and curiosity. Some speculated that Igno had moved on to other projects. Others noted the timing with various cryptocurrency launches. The rumor mill churned.

But for those who had worked closely with Igno, the personal nature of the departure seemed genuine. As one community member observed: "Life is complicated. Terrible events can occur and come seemingly out of nowhere, loved ones can get sick or, god forbid, pass away suddenly. Really, there are dozens of reasons why Igno might actually need to take time away from a project like this for personal reasons."

The months passed. Igno's August 2019 forum post would be his last.

## I Am Ignotus

A community member proposed a tribute: signing forum posts with "I am Ignotus"—a reference to the "I am Spartacus" scene, where characters claimed a shared identity to protect their leader.

The initiative sparked debate. Some found it moving. Others thought it performative or premature—Igno wasn't dead, after all. The moderators eventually clarified that their existing rule against signing posts applied regardless, though the rule had nothing to do with censorship.

The episode illustrated something important about the Grin community: even in tribute, it valued substance over spectacle. The best way to honor Igno wasn't through symbolic gestures but through continued work on the project he had started.

## What Igno Built

Igno Peverell's contributions to Grin and cryptocurrency more broadly were substantial:

**The implementation itself**: Igno took Tom Elvis Jedusor's whitepaper—a theoretical sketch—and turned it into working code. From his first commit in October 2016 to his departure in 2019, he built the foundation that everything else rested on.

**The culture**: Igno set the tone for how Grin would operate. Pseudonymous contributors. No ICO. No premine. Transparent governance. Technical rigor. These weren't just policies; they were values that Igno embodied and that the community absorbed.

**The team**: Igno recognized and encouraged talent. Yeastplume, who would become Grin's most prolific developer, was drawn in by Igno's work and vision. So were the other core contributors who would carry the project forward.

**The ethos**: "He never once looked down upon any member of this community," one community member wrote, "and always encouraged everyone regardless of skill-set or background to take part in the project without fear of repercussions or ridicule."

## The Project Continues

Grin's design had always assumed that contributors would come and go. The protocol didn't depend on any individual's continued involvement. The code was open source. The documentation was public. The community owned the project collectively.

This wasn't just rhetoric—it was tested by Igno's departure. And the project survived.

Yeastplume continued his wallet work. Jaspervdm and antioch maintained the node. Lehnberg coordinated governance. New contributors emerged. The hard forks happened on schedule. Development continued.

It wasn't the same without Igno. The community had lost something irreplaceable—not just technical skill but a particular kind of leadership, quiet and principled. But it had gained something too: proof that the decentralized ideal actually worked.

## Looking Forward

What will Grin become? The honest answer is: no one knows.

The protocol is stable. The community is resilient. Development continues at whatever pace volunteers can sustain. The scheduled hard forks are complete, and the consensus rules will remain unchanged unless the community decides otherwise through established processes.

Grin may achieve widespread adoption. It may remain a niche tool for privacy enthusiasts and cryptography researchers. It may be superseded by better technology. It may persist quietly for decades, maintained by a small but dedicated community.

All of these outcomes are possible. None of them diminish what has already been accomplished: a group of pseudonymous developers, inspired by a mysterious whitepaper, built a new kind of money from scratch. They did it in the open. They did it without corporate backing. They did it the way they believed software should be built.

The MimbleWimble whitepaper appeared in July 2016. The Grin genesis block was mined on January 15, 2019. The story continues.
